17,"The hotel room is super clean but even the simple amenities are missing as vanity kit, dental kit etc. If you forget to bring, unfortunately they do not provide since they do not have in the hotel. But the hotel is still okay as a four stars. The lobby is so much crowd since it is in the town. There are many people are sitting at the lobby area and you do not understand if they are hotel guest or some others from outside.I had an issue during my stay and thank you to Mr. Hazem (Night manager) to follow up and sort out immediately. And also another special thanks to Daisy, she was so helpful during my check in and check out.Small tip: Do not give a connected room the guest who wish to have a quiet room.","June 10, 2019","0    Four Points By Sheraton Downtown Dubai

18,"We hosted an eid dinner for our family and friends at the Party/meeting room at the hotel. Our experience was superb. The servers Rahul and Swarna were absolutely at their best. I cdnt expect a better service from them. Really loved the way they served everyone with a smile and were constantly available to serve the guests.Similarly, Chef Afroj Alam was amazing. Not only did the food taste great, Chef's presence throughout the dinner time and his supervision ensured that food was refilled on time and the guests were satisfied. We have received so many messages from people attending the party regarding the cost and all because everyone loved the food. The food taste and quality was definitely the highlight of our party. I cannot thank the chef enough or recommend him enough. He really deserves praise.In all, it was a great experience and I am pretty sure we will in sha Allah be organizing some event at Four points by Sheraton again. Plus we will be regular customers at Purani Dilli restaurant.","June 8, 2019","0    Four Points By Sheraton Downtown Dubai

The Yesterday Pub is a great spot. The room was large and had everything we needed. The gym, breakfast buffet and pool are all OK if a little small. Our only complaints were the AC wasn’t working properly in our room. When we called for assistance the engineer decided to change all the filters whilst we were in the room. A lot of work and still the AC didn’t get working properly - we slept at 25 C. The WiFi was also a little slow. ","June 3, 2019","0    Four Points By Sheraton Downtown Dubai

22,"We enjoyed a six day sojourn at this hotel. Greeted by friendly staff and we enjoyed their services throughout our stay. Check-in and Check-out was very efficient and informative and you were made to feel an honored guest in the hotel. Our room on the first floor was large and bright and included all amenities necessary to make our stay very pleasant indeed. Views from the window were not the best but this is typical of downtown Dubai where there is nearly always an adjacent building. Construction nearby was not an issue due to the excellent soundproofing. Pool, spa and massages available on the rooftop for guests to enjoy or just laze by the pool with a cool beer from the poolside bar. Complimentary shuttle service to various locations in the city.

28,"I recently stayed at 4 Points Sheraton for one evening. Check in was smooth until I was advised I had not included breakfast, despite having chosen a breakfast package. I explained this but the female desk staff were adamant and would not offer a complimentary breakfast, all of 80 dhs, despite being a Silver Elite member. The saving grace for this hotel was the spacious room and the great bed and pillows. The pool was also pleasant. I had dinner in the restaurant but the chicken parmigiana was served as a bowl of spaghetti with some chicken on top, seems the recipe was lost in translation. Having drinks with a colleague in the bar was unimpressive as every TV was turned up full volume, so much so conversation was impossible and the sound was almost physical. Staff went through the motions of turning down but to no avail. I commend Shantelle for her efforts to make the situation pleasant and Head of Housekeeping for airing the room which was smelly. Unfortunately I will not visit again.","May 19, 2019","0    Four Points By Sheraton Downtown Dubai

The staff are super friendly, the food was great and we found the location convenient to the airport and downtown. Each afternoon we enjoyed relaxing by the pool watching the sun set before heading down to the restaurant for a delicious dinner.

He saw I was in a standard room facing a building he moved me to a preferred room with a better veiw! And he saw I didn't get breakfast and offered breakfast to me for only 25 AED.

44,"we booked this pre-cruise hotel for a couple of night because it was a good brand and the title in the description 'Downtown' We know we would want to go to the Dubai Mall and the local restaurants for breakfast on evening meals and thought that having a downtown hotel we could simple stroll to these places. It turns out that we are no where near downtown Dubai and what more it is at least a 40 dirham taxi ride and approx 20 minutes driving time away from the mall and downtown Dubai. when i quizzed the staff about this they explained that when the hotel was built about 15 years ago the area around it was downtown - WAS - this is on unforgivable marketing ploy to sell this hotel and would not be allowed in any normal civilised country. most of our fellow guests are taken aback by this and the extra unnecessary expenses this incursto the holiday. totally misleading and needs to be changed. the hotel and staff are very good and no complaints in that area and the hotel is spotless but due to its current location there is absolutely nothing close by, and i mean nothing.!","May 3, 2019","0    Four Points By Sheraton Downtown Dubai

57,"We stayed at this resort for 10 nights, at arrival at 10am we were told we had to wait 4 hours for our room, therefore half of our first day was wasted waiting around.The hotel is very lively which we expected but didn’t realise it’s basically a party hotel.Our room was very clean at all times, thanks to Mark and Rahaul.The food in this resort is very poor, we paid a lot of money to stay at this resort little did we know that most of the bars is not all inclusive and the all inclusive drinks menu is also very poor.They have a Chinese restaurant which was lovely however 160 AED per person is not great as a couple we had 320 AED so still paid around £50.00 on top of the bill, for the money we paid to come to the hotel you would expect to have whatever you want.There is also a Italian restaurant on site, however the menu is covered with fish, which is great for fish lovers but if not your stuck with Bolognese, no pizza or carbonara or any basic Italian food, again 160 AED per person with the all inclusive package is not a lot considering the prices on the menu.The BLVD restaurant are very helpful and friendly, however the food is very poor, breakfast is always cold and any requests for cooked eggs you were waiting around 20 minutes.The set lunch menu at BLVD was excellent, menu has a lot of options for different cultures.BLDV in the evening is terrible, the food is not culture friendly at all, everything was very poor, one evening all my partner had was 3 boiled potatoes and she did not like anything else, we then had to go back to the room and then pay £20.00 for room service for one margarita pizza.The Penthouse lovely view- shame all inclusive is not included up there and they also advise you 1 hour stay unless your going to spend 1300 AED, why would you want to spend that kind of money on top of paying all inclusive.There was one waiter who really made our stay at five palm a bit more enjoyable was Ravi, he would call our room every morning and let us know he has got sun loungers for us, after breakfast he would have a bucket with water waiting for us, he could honestly not to enough and he deserves to be much more than just a waiter at the resort as his customer service is excellent and he does really go before and beyond.Overall unfortunately this is not somewhere we would recommend for 22 year old couple’ to come all incisive unless you love to party and don’t eat the entire time your there, we have stayed in many resorts in Dubai at this has to be the worst. The food and drinks are very very poor in the all inclusive package, definitely not worth the money we paid","July 14, 2019","1    FIVE Palm Jumeirah Dubai

58,"We stayed here for 5 nights. The service was second to none. All the way from getting out of our taxi to checking out, we were served most attentively. The amenities and our room was luxurious and the food was excellent. I recommend staying here for sure. A couple of things to watch out is that meals in the all inclusive are actually on a full board basis only and are limited to a budget of 160 aed which might sound like a lot but isn’t and only certain drinks and spirits are included. The only other thing which let the Five down for us was that The Penthouse seemed unnecessarily blocked off in that all tables were ‘reserved’ but really what they wanted was an upfront minimum spend and all inclusive ended at 5pm. I really recommend the pool party in the main pool on a Friday, it was great fun! Certain people really went out of their way to make the stay most comfortable for us: Yash and Roop serving at the main pool - my boyfriend lost his phone and everyone rushed to help to find it and Yash was always looking out for us and knew our names and drink preferences, Monty working at the Deliseree was also most attentive and took the time to get to know us and as such, we went there for breakfast every day instead of the main buffet. Also a gentleman called Clive working in Quattro Passi was great. Lastly, cannot remember her name but a Filipino lady working in Maiden who was also an opening cashier took care of us for drinks. She was excellent too.","July 14, 2019","1    FIVE Palm Jumeirah Dubai

68,"I have been holidaying in Dubai for nearly 20 years and have more or less seen it all. However the Five is my new go to place permanently. This time we had gone to celebrate my son's 18th birthday, and were blown away. As all Dubai hotels the hotel was stunning, luxurious , had amenities and a view and food to die for. However what made this place special was the young vibe, the cool pool party scene with the most talented of DJs. That said the most important part were the absolutely amazing staff ,who all went out of their way to make my son and our family feel incredibly special during his celebration. A huge shout out to Vipin and Kanaka the wonderful chefs who created special vegetarian food for us in the buffet restaurant, together with Ulkarsh our attentive server. Massive thanks to all the staff in the fabulous Chinese restaurant who looked after us every evening with the most amazing food and cocktails. Ira and the housekeeping team for their care , as to Anna and Kavinda by the spa pool and Faiyaz at the luggage desk. The list goes on and on but a huge thankyou to you all!!! However a particular team just made our holiday and deserve the most special mention and that is Nexy, Suhas , Arvind, Rajen the chef and delightful Monty in the coffee shop.

We were recommend by family living over there. From the moment we checked in everything with 10/10, the room was beautiful, the food was beautiful and the pool was always lively! i would defiantly say this is more of a hotel for people looking to party or be in a lively environment and not so much for families with young children, however there is slightly quite areas around the hotel. As stated all of the staff were amazing however i have to give a special thank you to certain members that made our stay. Jenny and Krishna (i hope that is spelt correctly) from BLVD One - Jenny was such a smiley welcoming face to see in the morning and Krishna was so lovely and attentive - both always making that extra effort to please in everyday! and also to Nur and Leon in Quattro Passi - the food here was just amazing but the staff made it even better! both again, nothing was too much to ask especially as i am such a fussy eater! they both made so much effort and were so polite!

The Palm Jumeirah Five is beautiful, immaculate and exquisitely decorated, attention to the fine details is absolutely amazing. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the friendly reception Manager Mustafa, along with his team, they have made our stay delightful. The staff at the main restaurant BLVD Adnane, Vivek and Kahnu are fantastic - they were attentive, friendly and breath of fresh air every time my husband and I came to this restaurant. Not to mention the ladies at The Spa at Five have top our experience. I would definetely recommend this hotel to everybody! It's a true sample of excellent hospitality.

The hotel is stylish, rooms are elegant and kept clean daily with fresh towels. There is a constant stream of taxis available 24 hours a day. Only disappointment is we didn’t get chance to try all the facilities the hotel has to offer like all the eateries, bars spa and gym etc.. The morning breakfast buffet is brilliant and they will make you anything you like.

116,"After a great break last year with my partner we decided to return with our teenage daughter as a treat at the end of her exams. Again there was an air conditioned car ready and waiting as soon as we arrived to take us to Atlantis. Unfortunately there was an issue with our room at check in and being tired from the journey we were not happy although every effort was made to accommodate us, but at 1.00am it was difficult to see this. We got a temporary room and after a good night's sleep, the following day whilst we enjoyed the water park the whole issue was resolved. This minor issue was swiftly forgotten as we enjoyed the splendour of Atlantis. There have been many changes since our previous visit, all good to maintain the Atlantis as a first class hotel in Dubai. The Imperial suite has been improved to great effect, the Wavehouse is a great place to spend an evening and the rooms refurbished. Again the food was great, the staff friendly and helpful and facilities excellent. We cannot recommend the Atlantis highly enough, our teenage daughter loved it and whilst we don't like going anywhere twice, we are now planning our third visit.

The general spa facilities are no longer included as part of the package, shame.

125,"A fabulous stay at the Atlantis. We come to Dubai regularly, at least once or twice a year. Having tried lots of amazing hotels in Dubai, I have to say, we throughly enjoyed our stay at the Atlantis.There are a few things to however bear in mind. This hotel is massive, and is primarily geared to families. Due to the sheer size of this place, you will definitely not get a personalised feel in this place. In fact there are people constantly everywhere.If you go to this hotel with this in mind, you will enjoy it, but you will need to come here expecting it to be very busy.We arrived early from our flight from the UK, and our rooms weren’t ready until 2.00pm. However, you are able to start using the hotel facilities. We made our way to the hospitality lounge, where we helped ourselves to some tea and some lovely cookies.The buffet restaurants, Kaleidoscope and Saffron were great. The amount of people flooding in these restaurants for breakfast and dinner was massive, but the hotel staff were doing a fabulous job to get everyone seated as soon as they could. We didn’t experience any queuing as we went for dinner early and at breakfast we avoided the peak times. However, we did see long queues to enter the buffet restaurants. There was a fabulous spread of food laid out. You can always find something to eat, even for my fussy child. Some of the food was very tasty.The staff at the hotel were very friendly, and made a big effort to ensure we had a great stay.The aquarium was great, as was the royal pool, only if you can get your head round to the fact, there are people everywhere. The security in the hotel was very apparent. There were security guards at all entrances, and at all the lifts and near the shops. Our room was in the tower near the aquarium. The pool had lots of lifeguards which was reassuring.We had a refurbished room. The size of the room was great. Not claustrophobic at all, and felt very spacious. The room was extremely clean. A special mention to our housekeeper, Pavan Dasari. He couldn’t have been more helpful. Always greeted us with smiles. He was very attentive, and he made sure everything was fine with our room. The room cleanliness was impeccable. It was these special touches that the staff made, that made our stay really enjoyable and memorable. Pavan Dasari is a real asset to this hotel. He certainly made our stay comfortable and enjoyable.You get access to the Waterpark. He went there once, but the wave pool and lazy river was closed as someone was sick in there, and they had to drain the water out. We left immediately and didn’t return, as my daughter who is 6 years old, didn’t want to go back. We were in and out of the Waterpark straight away due to the fact we only went there, to go on the lazy river and the wave pool.I used the gym which was great, but didn’t use the spa but it looked lovely.To sum it up. A great hotel, with fabulous staff. Expect it to be very busy at all times. As it is geared towards families, there will be lots of children everywhere. If you don’t mind this, then this is a fabulous place to stay.","July 12, 2019","2    Atlantis, The Palm

131,"The Atlantis Palm, is by far one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever been to. Traveling in over 10 countries, The Atlantis has a truly special interior. However, it’s such a shame that a beautiful hotel like this has such horrible customer service. Employees at check in made the whole process so terrible. We weren’t welcomed friendly even after upgrading to the imperial club. It was almost as if we were non existent. They don’t seem to care about concerns because they continue to ignore you and move on to something else. It’s sad to spend all your money at a place and expect to have a happy time. I personally feel you can spend money at a cheaper place and have amazing customer service that will do anything to make you happy. I highly recommend to spend your money at another hotel and just come to the Atlantis to visit, not to stay. It’s definitely not worth the money, it’s just all about the name.

133,We had a great time. The water park is fantastic but it’s a little too hot this time of year. We were half board and the food was amazing. We arrived at 2am and the check in was a nightmare! The staff are very focused on persuading you to upgrade which we did. They didn’t provide us with any information about the hotel or our upgrade but we were so tired we just wanted to get to our room. The room was nice but small and there were no coffee or tea facilities in the room. We had to wait around 30 mins for them to bring another bed and bedding for the sofa bed. We arrived so late it would have been better if these were already prepared. The wave room arcade is great fun but aside from that there’s not much to do in the evening as a family. Overall we had a great time. ,"July 11, 2019","2    Atlantis, The Palm

134,"We just got back from our week stay at Atlantis as a couple. I had visited the hotel before for the water park and restaurants but have previously stayed with Jumeirah. We altered our booking from Jumeriah to stay at Atlantis for a change, after seeing good reviews and always wondering what staying there is like! The pool was lovely, especially as the heat was crazy, but the pool and sunbeds did get extremely busy! Staff always help you find beds if there are none available though. All the staff were great and polite, especially in Kaleidoscope. We both found that the gentleman at check-out was very rude which was disappointing right at the end of our stay! There was also no help with the transfer and we were having to walk up to men and ask if they were there for us, which the transfer driver brought up and said is always a problem with this hotel. We enjoyed the free use of the water park and aquarium, and enjoyed going to the wavehouse arcade within the hotel. The hotel was lovely and cooled which was nice after being outside! We had an Ocean club room which was lovely and a lot more modern than we expected with lovely views of the sea. The cleaner was great and constantly checking if there was anything we needed. The rooms were not very soundproof at all and we did have trouble sleeping most nights due to a loud family next door, this could be as they were connecting rooms. Overall, we enjoyed our stay but found the half-board deal disappointing - there were only a few restaurants that did not require extra charges and a couple were outside only so were too hot to eat at this time of year when we tried them. Breakfast was lovely every day and all meals were all good - we mostly ate at kaleidoscope. The hotel was stunning and we did have a lovely visit, however we would choose Jumeriah over Atlantis next time as the overall experince was much better there. Atlantis was more suited for young children than couples holidays.During the trip we did a speedboat tour with Xclusive tours which was great and the burj Khalifa fountain boat trip which was also recommended. Taxis were available 24/7 out the front of the hotel which was useful as we did not hire a car. ","July 11, 2019","2    Atlantis, The Palm

140,"Having stayed 18 month ago I had high hopes for this stay. Sadly the entire stay was one disappointment after another. I upgraded to the 'Imperial Club' having done so previously. However it would seem that this up-selling is offered to the majority of the hotel with queues out of the door during each serving with people waiting 30 minutes for a 'premium' / 'exclusive' service. I contacted the management to discuss how disappointing this was on our first night but despite being told they'd contact me I'm still waiting. The waiting staff were polite and helpful but there simply weren't enough for the volume of people in the club lounge. The wait for a drink was as long as the wait to get in! The management of the lounge stood huddled sharing jokes rather than assisting their colleagues or speaking to disgruntled guests. There was a rather shambolic incident at the pool whereby after paying my bill, I was then told, the bill had been incorrect and the waiting staff insisted on giving me a new bill and taking drinks away.The hotel is beginning to look quite dated and garish but one we chose to stay in having received such wonderful service last time. However, this was not the case this time around. It seems that the priority for the management is number of guests paying high prices rather than ensuring guests have an experience that is reflective of the price they're paying. Given the sheer number of excellent hotels in Dubai there are far better options for the price.","July 11, 2019","2    Atlantis, The Palm

146,"Stayed at the resort for three nights and upgraded to the Imperial club. I have nothing adverse to say about the Atlantis, my time here was absolutely amazing! The service that we experienced from our transfer from the airport to check in and meals was amazing. The benefits of the Imperial club were unbelievable and we were made to feel like royalty. I couldn’t believe that amount of food, treats and drinks available at the Imperial club and really there was no necessity to go anywhere else to eat if you didn’t want. We ate breakfast daily at Saffron’s and I have never seen a buffet with so many options. We were totally blown away with every aspect of our stay and will definitely be returning. The staff couldn’t do enough for you and were brilliant. I can not recommend the Atlantis highly enough!

On arrival at the so called hospitality suite we were met with a very unpleasant lady who made us feel very unwelcome ! Just said 'no coffee or tea today!? After going back to inform Hassan of this we were allowed to have a breakfast instead of our last morning which seemed very fair. Apart from this our stay was absolutely fabulous, our cleaner was a lovely man who couldnt do enough for us. It was my birthday whilst there and there was a lovely cake waiting for us in the room.

150,"I was so excited to stay at the Atlantis and on the whole the hotel exceeded my expectations but there were just a few things that prevent me rating it a 5.Firstly we decided to arrive on a late night flight rather than and early morning flight so that we could wake up refreshed and ready to enjoy what was on offer. However the hotel was busy and I got put in a holding room for the night and advised to visit check in the next day to change rooms. The holding room was not good, it smelt damp and had paint all over the windows and dust sheets covering the balcony. I did know work was underway on the hotel but I didn’t expect to be put in a room that was part of the work. We did get moved to a much better room but it took me 3 trips to the check in area to sort this out. I don’t consider this service 5 star and I could see other guests who had arrived that day being given rooms whilst I was still waiting.We opted for the imperial club and so glad we did. Afternoon tea and evening drinks were excellent. I would recommend anyone to opt for this if budgets allow.The waterpark was great as well and having free entry meant we could go early morning before the crowds arrived and queues got big. I highly recommend getting the pool socks as the ground is extremely hot.We had half board and this was a really good option with plenty of choice. The buffet breakfast in both kaleidoscope and saffron were plentiful and had more than you could imagine. Asia republic and the tbh burger did a fantastic meal on the half board offer. The worst meal we had was unfortunately in bread street kitchen where we had to pay a supplement. Starter and main were great but my dessert of panacotta was like rubber. Wavehouse was fun and we enjoyed an evening having a few drinks and dancing.All in all we had a great time despite the few issues and none of them would stop me going back or recommending it ","July 10, 2019","2    Atlantis, The Palm

151,"Wow, wow, wow! I have just returned from the most amazing week at the Atlantis at the very start of July & absolutely gutted to be home. Atlantis cannot be faulted. They provided every service we signed up for. We booked a King room under the Imperial club package & everything from the room, the services received from housekeeping, waiters, security was phenomenal. I was a bit worried after reading recently a lot of reviews which weren’t good reviews however I do feel after witnessing some very rude/stuck up people, I believe that there was clearly a bit much being asked of the hotel & services. I research literally everything prior to travelling and I would only ever write a true review. Noted below are pros & cons & tips the hotel could possibly take note of for future:- Pros;Every single request I added to my booking regarding Palm view, room away from works currently being carried out & newly refurbished were met. We arrive at 8am and check in isn’t officially until 3pm, we were invited to use ALL facilities (hotel doesn’t need to allow this as you’ve not officially paid for that morning/day until after 3pm!). A text at 1130am to say our room was ready. Luggage was in room before we’d even reached the room. Imperial club benefits of happy hour/snacks is 100% worth it. We didn’t use the benefits everyday but even for the times we did use it was worth it, we had bottles upon bottles of prosecco and never paid for them due to being included in the happy hour service. The servers in the imperial are second to none, checking chairs to ensure ladies/gents in their outfits wasn’t sitting on wet chairs from afternoon tea service. Security around the whole building was great, not that I’ve ever felt at risk in Dubai ever but it was crazy seeing how secure they were there. Water park included was brilliant as previously I paid to enter and was around £60 for 1 visit per person. The housekeeping are obsessed with cleaning your room for you which surprised me as other staff in other hotels love it when you don’t want your room serviced. I liked how they wanted to clean for you, even if you were in the room or if you could give them a time to come back! Was really nice to feel like they wanted you to have a fresh bed to come home to after dinner (room serviced twice a day).The whole building smells phenomenal, no idea what they use but wow, the smell is incredible. The service included in imperial includes pick up drop off from airport. We didn’t require pick up, but used drop off and the driver was brilliant, on time, taught up some Dubai knowledge as we headed to airport & was extremely helpful. Breakfast selection was HUGE! Imperial club do a quieter smaller buffet which I noticed on the reviews had a lot of complaints about how it didn’t have much of a selection, I think some people are missing the point of it - it’s there to be a quieter option and the imperial lounge isn’t as big as the restaurants which have the buffet breakfasts. It’s perfect for something light to eat, if you want a 4 course breakfast, then go to the other restaurants to eat!You don’t have to give a card on file if you don’t want to charge to room. We never and no issues. We never wanted to charge anything to room or touch mini bar. Massive towels are available for use at beach or pool for no extra charge. Housekeeping provide you with as much bottled 500ml water as you need - stock up, take them to the pool in morning as the refreshments bar doesn’t open until 10am. By then your water will be warm and you’ll need to get some more. Cons;There is a lot of travellers there who are EXTREMELY rude and their children have NO manners. Many times whilst queuing for the food in the imperial lounge, people were allowing their children anything from the starting age of say 3 to help themselves and this was a problem!! Children were skipping queues, touching food with their hands and putting it back, screaming at the top of their lungs and rudely interrupting the staff as they were talking to other guests. This was out-with the hotels control, after all it is absolutely up to the parents of these children to be supervising their kids. The hotel I do think could introduce a policy where they do not allow children to help themselves to food, they should be supervised. I have no issues with families/children on holiday at all, I do have issues with them not having manors and being unsupervised! There were also so many well behaved/supervised children. The charges for drinks (soft) are extortionate even with half board. Half board doesn’t included soft drinks and we had a bill for 58 AED for 2 300ml cans of juice. That is over £12.50. Crazy. Take water in your bag!! I think that was very steep. As you can see the cons bar 1 is out with the hotels control. I think the hotel could be more strict on the children running around the food areas touching food which would definitely help. One girl who was around 4 in Saffron evening buffet was at the desert counter and removed with her fingers licking her fingers each time she removed sweeties from every cake on the stand and walked off. Her mother was too busy deciding what she wanted to eat to have even noticed her daughter wandered off. Scary enough that your allowing your eyes to come off her for a start but to be touching all the food that’s out for everyone else is terrible. The hotel was amazing. The staff were incredibly helpful and nice to deal with. The pool and beach was gorgeous. Everything was amazing and I had one of my best holidays ever & that is 80% down to the Atlantis for providing us with such phenomenal service. I will 100% be back. Thank you!

Room service menu needs more variety and overall room is clean. Rooms are little small however they are suitable for that pricing. The parking space in basement was a little cramped and need more space management. Other cars are parked in such a way that we were not able to take ours.

176,"Despite of the many offers I received from other hotels, I decided for Citymax Hotel at Bur Dubai because of the unbeatable deal it offered and the amazing reviews and recommendations from colleagues, and erstwhile guests. It was indeed a very good decision. I enjoyed the peace and quiet that was needed.Citymax Hotel provides great quality service. The room was comfortable and clean, wonderful location and a great front desk staff to help you with whatever you need. My room faced the street yet very little traffic noise was heard.Every staff member with whom I came in contact was attentive, kind and professional. They maintained a positive attitude and ensured I felt welcome during my stay. They treated me with dignity and respect. I was amazed at the consistency in their peformance and willingness to go the extra mile.The staff was well groomed and took pride as representatives of the Citymax Hotel. Mr Anu at the Front Desk is to be commended for his sheer professionalism and zen-like calmness in an otherwise crowded Reception area. Ms Deepshikha and Ms Princess from Operator/Guest services ensured that my stay was comfortable and would periodically check if I needed anything. These young men and women work tirelessly to bring excellence in customer service and add value to the businesses they proudly represent.The hotel is located at an easy walking distance to some of the most authentic and pocket-friendly Indian restaurants and local eateries on this side of Dubai. Supermarkets and pharmacies are in abundance, and offers best deals on daily consumables. Citymax Hotel gives good value for the price of the room and I will definitely stay here again when in Dubai. I wish them continued success and growth.","June 30, 2019","3    Citymax Hotel Bur Dubai

211,"The Citymax Hotel in Bur Dubai is a hotel, which gives actual value for money in the rather high-end hospitality industry in Dubai. Located in a very convenient location in Mankhool and a short walk away from the Karama Metro Station, this hotel offers all one needs for a comfortable stay.We found the rooms to be comfortable and clean, though the beds took some getting used to. The bathrooms were nice and the Wi-Fi worked well. Food options too were really good; particularly the Indian restaurant on the ground floor. The service quality was nice; the staff were helpful and quick to assist on any requirements we had. Considering that one can get a room here for a much lower price than most other similar hotels in the city makes it a really good value option.","May 15, 2019","3    Citymax Hotel Bur Dubai

227,"So I’m writing this review just after I’ve been trying to get to sleep for the last 30 minutes. I haven’t been able to sleep because the pillows are just awful. They’re itchy, they’re flat and just downright painful to sleep with. Just after 30 minutes of trying my neck is aching really badly and is in agony which isn’t very beneficial for me due to the simple fact that I’ve got a 9 hour flight tomorrow at 9 in the morning. So I’m going to be tired or even exhausted if you’d like, along with a agonisingly painful neck. This is just great. I have been to many different premier inns throughout my travels and this one is the worst one that I’ve ever stayed in by far. Usually the sleep experience is what premier inns are normally known for. However, this one embarrasses the hotels reputation by putting their guests who pay for a good nights sleep in pain. Overall I do not recommend this premier inn for anyone who’s looking to stay here unless you want your neck to be put in pain!","July 5, 2019","4    Premier Inn Dubai International Airport Hotel

244,"Premier Inn Dubai International Airport, Garhoud, DubaiReview covers the hotel with reference to food/beverages at Costa Coffee and Mr Toad’s Pub & Kitchen Restaurant inside the hotel.The Premier Inn is just about the most convenient ever – stay at the airport but, not physically in the airport - the place is couple hundred metres from International Terminal 3 – you can actually see it. It’s across the busy Airport Road and half-dozen subsidiary side roads/ramps in the residential area of Garhoud – other side of the Metro Red Line too so. You can’t walk to the hotel trailing your luggage.Fortunately – as you’d expect - there’s a hotel shuttle and it’s available every 30 minutes 24/7; leaving the hotel on the hour/half-hour and, 10 minutes later, arriving at the airport before returning. Follow the ‘shuttle arrows’ as you exit customs/immigration with your luggage – the hotel bus(es) are available across the line of taxis in the second service road.The hotel also provides a daily shuttle to Dubai Mall – there and back - to a set timetable. Dubai Mall is where you find the world’s tallest building with tickets AED180+ (depending on extras purchased) to the 124th floor. Just imagine.We’d arrived at Dubai for 05.00 – still dark and with ambient temperature comfortable 33 degC; an hour later we were in hotel reception. Familiar with tired long-distant passengers looking for a shower/bed, the friendly lady at reception provided us with a room - six hours before normal entitlement. We dumped our bags, headed back to the Costa Café to wind down after 24 hours ‘on-the-road’. The hotel was quiet. We had a room (#206) over-looking the airport with aircraft parked in-line alongside the terminals (counted 23 one morning). There was continuous stream of traffic on Airport Road, but you couldn’t hear things.The room was conventional – ensuite immediately to the RHS as you enter, L-shaped living space with double bed and second-fold-out bed to the right and table, wardrobe & services in front of you – coffee/tea-making/cups/jug, wall television, table-level refrigerator. Clean, functional, comfortable. We had three nights in which to enjoy the comfort of the bed/room.Shower is in the bath in the ensuite – this means that you need to climb up and over the rim of the bath. There are no hand-holds and, once wet, the curved base of the bath is/was slippery where the friction pad had gone missing. Take care if you’re heavy on your feet. Bathroom was clean. Spare toilet roll. Wash-basin drained s…l…o…w…l…y (paint drying speed) – clearly partly blocked wastewater pipeOutside the room there was that delightful swim pool on the roof – the highly exposed roof; mid-year and >40 degC late morning – time during which to treat the sun with respect. Great views across this low-level part of town – all those pastel/white colours, hazy air and shadowy high-rise on the horizon. About the Nuevo/Mr Toad’s Restaurant then? Eat breakfast there and the choice is either ‘BIG’ – eat as much as you like – for AED58 or continental at AED37. We opted instead for Costa’s Café. Evening meal in the restaurant, however, was a natural choice. We chose to eat in the industrial ‘Irish Pub’ section of the restaurant first time round;- there’s also a regular dining room where we ate the following evening. A couple of beef-burgers/fries and 500 ml water cost AED81 when taking advantage of our two-for-the-price-of-one card provided by the hotel (single burger meal AED70); and same option that provided a more interesting/tasty meal – Chicken masala & rice with the same deals (AED76). Good value then.The pub has a bar to one side and seating out front amongst steel girders, brickwork and shallow platforms. Large wall photos illustrated the early days of aviation in the Emirates – with lots of nostalgia for those of a particular age. When did you last travel on a BOAC Comet4 – mid-60s probably?And Costa Coffee? We opted for breakfast there - coffee, croissant & jam x2 AED46.25 (but this also came with hotel card and hotel/room discount of AED16.75). Similarly, shared lunch – 2xchicken/avocado wrap, 1xalmond croissant, 1xcoffee & 1xflavoured water – cost AED75.50. Comfortable, spacious, open table/seating to one side of reception, friendly wait lady, clean, presentable.Hotel people were friendly/helpful from the start and throughout our stay – trolley/luggage delivery/collection/room, reception/information, room/corridor services, restaurant/café, shuttle coaches.For a three-night stay we paid AED691.50 (€167). This included VAT, municipal tax, service charge (in total 22% extra) and AED10 tourism fee.In summary then: hotel is particularly convenient for a short stop-over in the Emirate – value for money, easy access into town, friendly/helpful staff, easy/popular choice meals when eating in-house.Peter Steele20 June 2019","June 25, 2019","4    Premier Inn Dubai International Airport Hotel

We ate in the restaurant for lunch and dinner and it was beautiful, one of the nicest steaks we have ever had, again the staff couldn't of been more helpful. My friend who lives in Dubai joined us for dinner and was very impressed by the menu and said she would 100% go there to dine again. There is also a pool, hot tub and gym on the top floor.Overall this hotel was great value for money and we couldn't thank Zanhrit and the rest of the staff enough for making us feel so welcome.

They apparently tried to charge a day before & I guess I was midair in my 14 hour flight. & no one bothered to inform me because my bank won’t allow it unless I call them to authorize the transaction. Everyone knows how terrible their wi-fi is. So calling my bank was out of question. Luckily, I have another card from my home country & that was the one I used.

I would like to single out Jocelyn, a waitress at the restaurant. A sweet and charming person always with a pleasing smile. I noticed the dedication and professionalism that Jocelyn portrayed in the course of her duties. Always available to help and assist customers with a “Can Do” attitude.

Even though we insisted that we could take our baggage with us, they sent a hotel personnel later on who brought our bags. We just wanted to get some sleep but the personnel wouldn’t leave without tips. Unfortunately we did not have any cash with us then. It got pretty awkward. We should have thought about that and the whole experience ruined our mood totally. Next night around 9 or 10 while we were getting dressed to go out, we heard a knock on the door. I wasn’t sure if it was our door. And then we heard someone opened the door and come in. My partner answered and it was a hotel personnel who asked if we need anything. It was ok at that time but it got really scary the next night when hotel personnel opened the door and came in to our room while we were taking a bath and were half naked. It was really very unpleasant experience. I wonder why do they have to come inside and ask if we need anything.Apart from that our experience was good. The breakfast service was amazing.

She will give you the burden of taking permits for your event when in fact it is her job to do so. She will never follow up on matters as important as menu and blame you if you do not remember to remind her that you have to chose between their menu options.

290,Pulling into the front of the hotel is very crowded as valet drop off area is small. Once entering the lobby the area is very large with shops and restaurants. Check in was very easy and the staff exceptionally friendly and informative. The room was surprisingly large. We had a balcony but could not access it as it was locked. The interior of the room is becoming dated. The bathroom was a great size and spacious. Check out was very easy and again staff was very friendly.,"March 9, 2019","5    JW Marriott Hotel Dubai

Many complementary services are not available like fruit basket for premier customers, market place option we got normally before. Staff attitude is not good as it was. I miss the good time spent with Raj, jaguriti and walima...only walima left and the only good staff member if I compare with the past. I m planning to move some other hotel for remaining days.

295,"After working for months with hotel staff regarding a group of 63, our rooms were given away as the hotel was overbooked. Our guests who had been traveling for over 26 hours and arrived literally in the middle of the night were forced to wait in the lobby as guests were checked in one-by-one and provided rooms other than discussed. We were very disappointed with the hotel staff. The agreed upon plan was that guests' keys would be waiting and keys would be distributed at one time so no one had to wait. It did not happen that way. We had some very unhappy mutual clients. This caused me to provide four stars instead of five.Otherwise the rooms were spacious, well appointed and clean. The ten on site restaurants provided a great variety. This hotel has an indoor courtyard, nightclub and rooftop pool with bar. The service was absolutely amazing! The staff is truly committed to making sure guests have a great experience and are well taken care of.The concierge staff was beyond outstanding ...we needed some last minutes items, banners, etc., and they made the contacts and arrangements for us and had everything delivered to our room.This hotel is close to the airport and easy to get to the main attractions in Dubai. The Metro station is a five minute walk.I highly recommend this hotel. We are taking another group in November and will.take extra efforts with the hotel staff to make sure they do not overbook and give our rooms away again!","February 21, 2019","5    JW Marriott Hotel Dubai

Almost a suite really with working desk, settee, walk in shower etc.Good range of restaurants including Italian, Asian and an exceptional steak house (try the ""tomahawk"" if you have a good appetite).All in all this looks to be a great choice for either leisure of business visits and has the advantage of being relatively close to the airport (15 minute taxi ride) .","February 2, 2019","5    JW Marriott Hotel Dubai

299,Regularly staying here already a couple of years this is not the most modern Marriott you can spend you're money on in the Dubai Region. However this lack of modern style is fully compensated by extreme friendly staff.For instance King has prepared your drinks already for breakfast (Market Place) before even ordering them.

301,"I stayed for 6 nights at this property with my extended family in Jan'19. My overall experience with the property was excellent! I booked the property directly with the hotel's reservation team and big thanks to Mr Nicolas who not only helped me get a good rate, but also allowed me kitchen access nder chef supervision to meet specific dietary requirements of the kid and infant I was travelling with. I know this is not easy to organize, so really appreciate the hotel management going beyond expectations in making my stay very comfortable. Big thanks also to Chef Ahmed and Chef Gyan who made sure that my family was well taken care of in terms of Indian food, especially for the kids. The staff at the restaurants were also very helpful and served with a smile The rooms are quite big and adequately stocked with amenities. The executive lounge is also a good place to have few snacks and soft drinks/juices when someone has some time- the staff in the lounge was also very friendly and courteous. I have all good things to stay about the property and its hospitality. If there is one nitpicking I would do is to say that some of the staff at the reception could be more warm, esp with people of Indian/South East Asian origin. But overall a 5* rating to the hotel. I would recommend the hotel to my colleagues and family :)","January 26, 2019","5    JW Marriott Hotel Dubai

303,"While the Property is labeled under the JW Category of Marriott chain, it doesn’t quite qualify for that level of luxury. But with that being said the place comes loaded with all kinds of amenities, features and facilities you can expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel and given the proximity to the Airport, it is a great Upper-end option for a Transit Stay LOCATION: Located in Deira area and just a few minutes away from the TERMINAL 2 of DXB Airport DINE + DRINK: This is where the hotel excels! They have such a wide array of Drinking and dining optons(a Sports bar and German Beer hall included!) you don’t even have to step out of the property. The breakfast spread was wonderful and absolutely worth waking up for ROOM: I stayed in 355, which was a huge SUITE room, so this review is based on that; VIEW: ; SIZE: Very spacious room; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Lovely.

The hotel is located a 5 minute taxi ride from the airport and indeed my room had good views of the airport, although any plane noise was well suppressed. My spacious room on the top floor was fine, although the décor was a little bland, especially when compared to the main public areas. Good WiFi. Really good staff, especially Nizel in the Viennese Café who was good fun to chat with. The Dubai Metro station is a 10 minute walk away and the Dubai Creek is about a 25 minute walk.

While we didn’t cook, the fridge and microwave was great to store and heat up left overs from dinning out as well as snacks from the grocery store behind the hotel. The washer/dryer was a big plus too. Definitely not in the same category as other Marriott properties. Property is starting to age. Dubai is the developing stages for tourism so standards and service are average. Great reception staff, sub par house keeping. Service is slow and our suite was skipped for cleaning 3 times in a 10 night stay. I had to request a cleaning each day and they still missed our suites. When they did clean, the forgot to leave towels or left inadequate towels or didn’t refill shower gel and soap. You had to keep calling for stuff and waiting for things. Sometimes, I just made do coz I felt bad for the front desk staff. I won’t stay here on another visit but overall, it wasn’t bad and the location was central in Deira.","January 8, 2019","5    JW Marriott Hotel Dubai

307,"I stayed at the JW Marriott Dubai for Christmas. The hotel staff was very nice. Starting with the check-in the staff did their best to accommodate our request for an upgrade. Although they were unsuccessful, we appreciated their efforts. Prior to checking I to our room, Patrick helped get our luggage to our room then spent a little time explaining all of the room's features, the hotel's restaurants and some general information about Dubai. He was extremely couteous, professional and helpful. The hotel room was small but comfortable. The bed was a little too firm for my taste. There was a huge tub in the bathroom. However, there is no slip guard in the tub or on the floor. Be careful as to not slip in the floor.The breakfast was great. There was something for all taste buds. There is a van that transports guests to the nearby mall with one of the largest aquarium, and the famous Burj Khalifa.The downside of our stay was that the restaurant for breakfasts gets extremely busy and felt like a cafeteria. Also, housekeeping did not leave soap or towels and we needed to call each day to requests housekeeping services. Finally, the elevators are extremely slow. Although there are four elevators it takes at least ten minutes for the elevator to arrive.","December 30, 2018","5    JW Marriott Hotel Dubai

The restaurant has a lovely warm feeling when you enter, every table has privacy with the very comfortable high back,leather armchairs, especially nice for couples, business meetings & private conversations. We had a very warm welcome from Emil in the festive surroundings, he explained the menu options. Henry was our server, his smile & excellent service added to the delicious food. As non meat eaters, (why go to a Steakhouse?) we made enquiries beforehand to see if the menu offered fish - plenty of choice. We chose the Christmas menu, we were given time to digest & enjoy each course. After the tasty Prawn & Scallop starter we were served the second course of Lobster Bisque which was spectacular when Henry flambéed the dish & the flavour was divine with the chunks of fresh lobster sitting in the bowl. Our main course was a succulent piece of salmon cooked to perfection. We ended our meal with delicious desserts after our leisurely meal served by attentive Henry in very comfortable surroundings - a great end to a lovely Christmas Day - how lucky we are.","December 25, 2018","5    JW Marriott Hotel Dubai

It makes things a lot cheaper. You can walk to two nice shopping malls within 10 minutes that have everything you need. It is a 15 minute taxi ride to the huge Dubai Mall, but the taxi only costs around 30Dhs which equates to about $US8.00 Try to have meals in local places which are very tasty and also cheap compared with other places.

The Viceroy Pub was the only alternative for a la carte, and it serves pub food which is ok but not great. The breakfast restaurant is crowded and not very appetizing - feels unhygienic with food items openly exposed to so many people. Coffee comes from a machine giving single servings. The quality of the food items was, in general, not great. Fruits were hard and tasteless. Hash browns were wet and cold. ","June 21, 2019","6    Four Points by Sheraton Bur Dubai

But the welcome right from the door was kind and the reception staff were helpful, smiling and interested in where we’d been. We got great tips for our next trip in the Middle East. They had a hot pot of spiced tea there, which was really good. We got a late checkout. What we really liked was that for the first time on our trip, people helped us without putting their hands out for a tip (which made us want to give one more). The room was very pleasant with a comfortable king bed and a big bath. The shower had massage pulse - great after a long walk. The waiting area was comfortable, had tea to drink, and free wifi without doing sign in hassle. The hotel was central in being halfway between the Burj Khalifa and the gold market on the creek. Though we didn’t use the restaurants there, since we like exploring local options even for breakfast, they certainly smelled lovely and were very clean. Staff got us a car when we needed one, and didn’t push when we wanted to walk. They helped with our suitcases without pushing for money. We’d definitely return to the Four Points by Sheraton when we stopover again.","March 12, 2019","6    Four Points by Sheraton Bur Dubai

It was a planned pleasure trip for the parents on their retirement, which couldn't have gone well if Four Point staff members were not so welcoming and helpful. Being in a different country brings-in a lot of questions/concerns/doubts, but hotel staff (esp. Amit) helped at every phase of the trip from arranging for vegetarian meals to planning their trip to Abu Dhabi. In short, at Four Points, you would find a home away from home.

In both rooms, the water temperature in the shower was hard to control. The temperature kept changing and I had to keep adjusting it to keep it from getting too hot or too cold. Also, each room has a window between the room and the bathroom. That is quite strange. There is a shade, but it opens from the outside. That would be awkward if there is more than one of you.

Historical places like Dubai Museum and the Old Souq are within reach by walking (for young travellers definitely not a problem). But if one feel tired after long walk, taxis are easy to get at very reasonable price. You can also use the taxi apps which i found very useful.

362,"We stayed at this property for 2 weeks in June. My very first experience at the hotel wasn’t pleasant - as I reached with my luggage, there was nobody at the door and I had to lug it up to reception myself. I was made to wait 15 mins to check in as there was only one assistant at the desk and she was busy. One star deducted for this.The standard room is of adequate size for up to 2 people, but any more people and it’ll feel too crammed. The room is fairly well decorated, the first night there was a slight odour of damp, but after running the air con all night it disappeared the next morning. The bathroom had an adequate bathtub, could do with some updating. The housekeeping staff was great on our floor, and any ad hoc requests (towels etc) were fulfilled quickly.I have deducted one more star because of the poor soundproofing in the rooms - any conversations in adjacent rooms or in the corridors can be heard clearly which can be very disturbing. One very loud family kept waking us up from 4am on our very last day! Staff at the front desk and around the hotel were very friendly over the two weeks; there were no major issues that we needed assistance with. There’s a nice pub at the hotel and one waitress, Nisha, has to be commended for her exemplary customer service! ","July 3, 2018","6    Four Points by Sheraton Bur Dubai

Location was ok as the metro station was very close by.The hotel inside is ok, we had a problem as they didn't want to give us a bed for our 5 year old, but there was a misunderstanding and we solved, however the room was very small and we barely had space to move.The hotel is very basic, the window had an ugly view of a dirty building next to us.Most channels on the tv didn't work.The breakfast was basic and the people who ate there weren't very well mannered, they kept grabbing everything with their hands, so this didn't make it very inviting!The staff was quite nice.We went to the Italian restaurant twice, it was very good.We weren't impressed at all with this hotel, for the price we paid especially.","May 13, 2018","6    Four Points by Sheraton Bur Dubai

368,"I having been staying quiet frequently with Four Points by Sheraton lately. This hotel provided consistent experience that I found in other properties under this brand.My check in and check out was fast. The reception staff was very professional and friendly. In my booking I asked for a quiet room and they indeed met my request. The room was spacious and had all basic necessities. The bed was comfortable. One draw back was the pillows: While they were comfortable I found 2 of the four pillows provided to be too thin. The hotel has a number of restaurants. I only went to the lobby cafe that is open 24 hours. They have a decent selection of food and beverage items. The prices are comparable to similar cafe in the area. The neighbourhood has a number of restaurants and supermarkets (including a mall with a very good food court) so finding a place to eat isn’t difficult. The hotel is located in a predominantly South Asian neighbourhood so most restaurants offer food from that region.The hotel has a gym and a pool and I found the hotel gym to be adequate for a short stay. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I would certainly consider staying at this property when I visit Dubai again.","April 15, 2018","6    Four Points by Sheraton Bur Dubai

376,"Stayed during February 2018 in a classic room, which was okay, but nothing special. The furniture and furnishings were a little dated and the room had clearly seen hundreds of guests over the years, since it was last updated.Breakfast was about average when it comes to choice, but the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The reception and concierge staff were very welcoming and extremely helpful. We took the courtesy shuttle to the beach one day, which is around a 30 minute drive away. It was fairly cheap to get a taxi back to the hotel (40 dirhams).The hotel is close to the creek, about a 10 minute walk and the metro is about a 5 minute walk away.The question you always ask yourself when you leave a hotel is 'would you return' and whilst the hotel location has some positive and negative points, and whilst the staff are very welcoming, the quality of the room (406 in this instance) and the breakfast were below average, so I'm afraid the answer would be no.","February 27, 2018","6    Four Points by Sheraton Bur Dubai

405,"Stayed at the Address Marina for 4 nights from the 25th May. We had a deluxe double with fantastic views of the pool and the marina. Room was smartly designed with all the extras (iron/hairdryer etc..) you might need for your stay. You could even bathe with a view of the Marina. Breakfast in the morning has everything you might want to set you up for the day. Plenty of choice and excellent quality. The staff were all very pleasant and knowledgeable. We booked tickets to the Burj Khalifa through the concierge and again he was knowledgeable and took no time in getting us booked in at the restaurant. The hotel has a fantastic pool and is busy during the day, if you leave it too late on in the day to get sun beds you could be disappointed. At night the pool area turns into a restaurant and bar. We didn’t dine here but heard good things about “Shades”. The hotel is directly attached to the Marina Mall so very convenient for shopping and the nearby restaurants and bars at Pier 7. The location is roughly a 10 minute walk from the beach where there is more shopping and more choices of restaurants. For me, the hotel was in a place that was convenient and close enough for the things that me and my wife wanted to do. Maybe for those with young families it could be too much of a trek to the beach and back? I would definitely go back to Address Marina. ","June 4, 2019","7    Address Dubai Marina

Only issue for me was there was no mirror in the actual bedroom (we stayed in a suite) but there was one in the bathroom and the corridor near the door. It is situated right beside the marina with nice views and places to eat very close by. It is also beside the mall if you want to do some shopping and even has a Waitrose inside. Swimming pool is a great size and the loungers around it are in an excellent position for having the sun most of the day. Sometimes the music was a bit loud for total relaxation but nothing major. We paid extra to have access to the executive lounge which we found to be very handy. Staff in the hotel excellent and very friendly.

432,"My husband and I had actually booked and paid for another Heritage area hotel, the Hotel Barjeel Heritage Guest House, but when we arrived in the evening after a very long and tiring flight we were told at that hotel that they were FULL (???) and they then called the Orient Guest House, who agreed to send someone to come pick us up to spend our one night before our cruise. At first we were both rather upset as we had planned far ahead to have an authentic Arabian hotel experience and forgo the glitzy high rise hotels, but when we saw our lovely Arabian style room, though small, with its obvious antique firnishings, the super comfortable king sized canopy bed and nice size bathroom, we calmed down. Our room opened right onto the ground floor breakfast patio area and had an ancient thick giant-sized wooden door with a huge old padlock. The room was very quiet and we slept great!  In the morning we enjoyed our breakfasts on the patio that we had ordered the night before we retired. We even had some delicious dates with our meal. I did wonder what the very thick ""bacon"" was slced from? It had quite a different taste. Somehow we missed seeing the roof terrace although we saw other guests heading up the stairs and just thought they were going to higher floor guest rooms. It would have been nice if the person checking us in the night before had mentioned it, but it was getting quite late. After breakfast we were amazed to discover that this hotel is located right in the heart of the Heritage Center and tour groups are walking all around that area. We loved how close it is to the canal, the Dubai Museum and so much more. I would choose to stay here again!","July 9, 2019","8    Orient Guest House

It is located in the Al Fahidi Historic District. I had no regrets at all booking the place. Hot showers and working air-conditioning, with a very comfortable bed. THe breakfast was buffet styel and more than sufficient. The price - it was a very good deal - well worth the money. To top it off, the staff were excellent and very accomodating to my requests. My friend and I came in at 5am and they accomodated us in the Majlis (a room for us to rest) and even agreed to change my friend's breakfast to the first day. He entertained my many other queries as well and was so very patient - thank you so much Patric! The lady at the reception (Lorena) was also great and very helpful! The hotel has no gym and pool but you can head over to their parent hotel the Arabian Courtyard Hotel where you can use their facilities free of charge.

After informing them that this would be inconvenient as we had another room at the hotel they asked if they could move us as well.We checked out the other hotel and said it would be find but asked for a compensation as the hotel that they wanted to move us to was 30 Euros a night cheaper than the hotel we originally booked.They ended up moving us to the other hotel but informed us that we had already paid for our stay and wouldn't be reimbursed at all (please remember this was a two night stay and a four night stay at a 30 € difference a night leading up to a difference of 180 € !). Then they let us know that we could cancel the booking with the original hotel we booked but we wouldn't be able to get the payment back that we already made (which was the full amount for the stay). So that didn't make any sense either.We didn't get an apology or any reimbursement at all! So please do not book this hotel, it was a bad experience, a terrible start for our vacation and led to a lot of confusion and annoyance before we even got there.","March 14, 2019","8    Orient Guest House

You enter into a courtyard and the reception office will be diagionally to your right. They reallly have put a big effort into preserving the historic nature of the site with delightful old padlocks for the doors, hardwood furniture and traditional decorations.The complimentary breakfast was fairly typical of Middle Eastern fare, with eggs, fruit, dates, homus, cream cheese, flat bread. However, they also serve a rotation of turkey sausuage and turkey bacon. The breakfast coffee is instant, which was disappointing (perhaps I am being a bit of a coffee snob here).The room's decor was very nice.

452,"Orient Guest House is a huge disappointment and absolutely not value for money. On arrival I was allocated a windowless box of a room, and refused to accept it. The drably furnished and painted room I ended up with was disappointing. The bed had two mean, hard pillows. One tiny cake of soap was provided in the bathroom - which didn’t even last a weekend – and in the bathroom the shower curtain clings to you, water leaks out all over the floor soaking the bath mat and the grouting was peeing off the bath in a long snake-like strip. There was no room service or cleaning at all. The reason given was I was supposed to hand in my key to reception, only was not told this. Apparently there are no spare keys for the cleaners. Hard to believe. The very high price did not even include breakfast, but that was no loss. It was a super cheap -looking buffet.. The hotel is in a great location, but is no better than a 3-star and worth only half the price at best – I’d say $70 max - until the service is substantially upgraded. It is owned by the Arabian Courtyard Hotel just up the road which is a much better option. I've stayed there a few times and always liked it. But If you want something with an Arabic ambience, go next door to the beautiful XVA Hotel. Orient really needs to clean itself up. Until then, stay away.

454,"I didn't take enough notice that this is only a guest house not a hotel. No bar, lobby, pool or restaurant.It's in the old town heritage district yes - but it's not a tourist district so it's not nearby to anywhere else you'd want to visit.If you were an older couple staying for one or two nights then this place would be great.The staff are wonderful! And there's free wifi.Not really suitable for anyone young, not younger western couples or families or anyone staying more than a couple of nights. No where really to sit and relax that isn't extremely hot. Room service is a longgg wait and not available 24/7.Book through hotels combined and can get a decent rate - however the rack rate is far over priced for what it's worth. Don't book through Amoma which advertised a twin room when actually there is no twin room in the place.Nice Arabian theme and far away from any of the glitz and glamour. Room so overcrowded with furniture though and couldn't get cold water but I hear that's standard in UAE in August.Staff were always so friendly and helpful.Nice cafe and tea room adjoining. Metro about 600m away. Consulates very close.","August 11, 2016","8    Orient Guest House

457,"Dubai: that's tall skyscrapers and modern buildings everywhere! Some of them display a stunning architecture, some of them are openly unimaginative and some are already a little bit dilapidated. However, there are just a few blocks where you can get an impression of bygone times. The whole area consists of a reconstruction of typical local architecture including the famous windcatchers to ventilate the houses. Of course it feels a tiny little bit like Disneyland, but it's still nice to pretend.The hotel stays true to the philosophy of make-believe and decorates the rooms accordingly, enhanced with modern accomplishments. The city centre is nearby, and owing to the secluded design, there is almost noise from the streets (except fro the muezzin). If you want luxury and modern achievements, stay somewhere else.

462,"If you are looking for something akin to a traditional Arab Riad, then this may suit.It's located in old Dubai, very close to the Dubai Fort Museum amongst a small medina of similar looking buildings and warren of alleys. Once you enter through the wooden doors it opens into a traditional courtyard with the rooms running off this and a smaller courtyard. There is also an upper floor which is where we stayed this time-nice outlook and there is a quite large upper deck where there are views out over the area and a place to chill if the weather is not too hot (summer on Dubai wouldn't be good up here!)We stayed here several Yeats ago and it hasn't changed at all in that time.The good points are it's not an anonymous large hotel and gives an insight into how the locals live ( we stayed in some mag nicest riads elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa and Orient is true to the style but certainly at the lower quality end).It's clean and comfortable although the rooms do vary a bit in size and even the larger ones are a bit cramped. It's nice to have breakfast in the courtyard and the breakfast on offer is ok without being outstanding. Staff are friendly and helpful and the location is good for doing some sightseeing that is off the beaten track ( local cheap restaurants, a nice walk along the Dubai creek shoreline, largish local souk selling textiles and a range of other stuff, take a small boat across the creek to visit the gold souk on the other side, Dubai museum/fort.)The things that could be improved is the speed of the checkin which can be a bit slow, the furnishing of the rooms try's to be faithful to antique look but it just comes across as old and a bit shabby, and the room cleaning was left to very late in the day when wee turned around 6pm which caused a bit of inconvenience.All up its a nice enough place and we would probably book here again when next in Dubai","December 15, 2015","8    Orient Guest House

Based around a courtyard where breakfast is served the rooms have character yet still have the modern conveniences such as free wifi, TV, en-suite etc. This is one of other guest houses in the same chain as the Arabian Courtyard hotel across the road from the Museum which is where we had a lovely evening meal. My one criticism is the way they have scrimped on staff. We had one girl book us in that afternoon who unfortunately was not exactly welcoming and obviously had a blanket response to questions which didn't allow her any flexibility or imagination. We had our booking form which clearly said breakfast was included but because her sheet said it wasn't she refused it. It was up to us to ring the manager and run around to get it sorted. Next day we went to breakfast where there was an extremely competent and friendly young man who it turned out took your order, cooked your breakfast, cleared the tables AND looked after the booking out and booking in of guests!

The Atheryat Center, next to the Arabian Courtyard Hotel in Al Fahidi st is also a great place to shop at reasonable prices.

474,"My wife and I stayed here recently for 3 nights. On arrival we opted for an early check in and were able to choose a room due to a number available. Opting for one on the upper floor we more or less had the upper terrace to ourselves as all other guests seemed to be in ground floor rooms. The room itself was spacious, well air conditioned and with a large modernized bathroom. Some of the furniture and fittings were a bit tired but they all worked and were comfortable. Breakfast is plentiful and served in the main courtyard after you have made your choices the nights before. Staff are pretty friendly and offer good customer service with the night staff seemingly being more helpful especially when needing help to find taxis and get things done. The guest house doesn't have a pool/spa but you are able to use one at the sister hotel less than 10 minutes walk away opposite the Dubai Museum, which is worth a visit. In front of the guest house is a great little tea house which has a refreshing mint and lime juice on the menu as well as some tasty lunches. Next to that a cafe that specializing in dishes with camel meat - we tried the house special and really enjoyed it, though portions are very large so take your appetite. Taxis can be easily caught from outside and the hop on, hop off tourist bus stops outside the Dubai Museum around the corner. About 25AED to the Dubai Mall and 45AED to the Mall of the Emirates. We had one issue when on the last evening before a very late check due to a 2am flight out, our air con started leaking with water going everywhere and became unusable. The night butler was happy to move us straight away to another room so we could shower, change and pack our bags before leaving for our flight. A charming place to stay in the throng of old Dubai.

Though a 15 minute cab ride to the heart of Dubai, such as the Burj Khalifa, the Oriental Guest House provided a glimpse of what Dubai was like years ago in a simpler life. And it was nice. The hotel itself was small and quiet, clean and well decorated with rooms surrounding the lovely courtyard. Our beds were comfortable and the rooms well appointed with a nice shower and all the amenities that go with it. The staff was eager to assist us, both with our luggage, as well as hailing a cab. A delicious breakfast was included which featured fresh breads, fresh squeezed juice and eggs made to order. The Orient Guest House is in more of the historical district and close to the Spice Market, though we did not have a chance to explore much. But it was a welcome respite after driving through Dubai with one skyscraper after another to find this quaint hotel at a reasonable price. It was perfect for our one night stay, and we would recommend it for stays in Dubai as an alternative to the large resorts and huge hotels, though perhaps for longer stays, a pool or beach hotel would be welcomed.

I eventually spoke to a man at the hotel, from the airport information desk, he said he had an airport pick up for someone was I him! I said I was not him, he then said that he did not get an email requesting a pickup actually the request was part of my booking. We arrived after a taxi fare of about AUD$80 it was about 11pm we were tired and it was very hot. The man at squeezy reception was totally inefficient and seemed to be upset at the intrusion - he asked did we had our booking paper? - I told him no, because we had no way of printing it but I did have the details - he had a very unwelcoming maner he snorted to clear his throat, coughed and mumbled and made some vague attempt to retrieve our booking on the computer, eventually saying that without the paper it was impossible. I asked if I could use the computer to retrieve the booking, he agreed. I showed him on the screen but he directed me to print it on the office printer he then took the printout and began the booking in process. At this stage a younger smartly dressed man arrived (from their other hotel across the street) made room for us to sit down welcomed us to the hotel and offered us a cool drink, we had been there close to an hour. He then disappeared, leaving us with the original man. He gave us the corner room closest to the reception, this had an air vent in the bathroom that went straight through to the reception area - which meant all sound (and anything else) travelled in either direction without any hindrance! We asked for another room in the morning. We were shown to another room (I think there was only 1 other guest so plenty to choose from ) by an absolute smiling joy of competence who was the young Filipino woman that was responsible for guests breakfasts and room service. She was lovely, helpful and friendly, nothing seemed too much trouble. It was her alone that stopped us moving to another hotel. I do hope this hotel make use of this review and allows the young woman to have a more responsible role with in this hotel - it would certainly benefit from her guest orientation. One more thing - the entire cost for this 4 day stay was taken out of our account 4 days prior to our arrival, not the usual process by the hotels we book through Agoda.","September 7, 2013","8    Orient Guest House

All is a bit worn-out, bathroom facilities are not up to the mark, rooms are dark and dingy and could also be cleaner. Breakfast is b&b level. If you think of coming in your own car, add 20minutes for arrival and for departure as there is no parking available and valet services are run by a nearby bigger hotel (the ""mothership"" of Orient Guest House).","June 4, 2013","8    Orient Guest House

There is parking nearby, but the machines would only allow 4 hours paid parking at a time, as a result I ended up with a parking fine.

I’ve revised and added some photos.We chose this guest house because we were in town for a conference but also intended to do some sightseeing and exploring. There were things we particularly enjoyed about the guest house:The international staff:Butlers—Veronica (Kenya), Abdul Razek (Pakistan) and Nathan (Zimbabwe). All were very kind and service oriented. Wait staff—Ahmed (Egypt), Samir (Pakistan) and Mary (Cameroon).The accommodations:The guest house is an 11 room Emirati home that has been restored. The building—exterior and interior are charming and a peek at an earlier life, at the edge of the Bur Dubai, a historical neighborhood. It feels like a bed and breakfast. When the house is not full, the butlers prepared breakfast for us to order; when it was, there was a buffet.The location:Adjacent to the Metro, it is also close to the ferry and boats on the Dubai Creek (as well as buses). Souk Al Kabeer, the textile souk, is a 5-10 minute walk. And my husband reminds me that Carrefour, a well stocked grocery store is nearby. Photos are from the rooftop and interior courtyard.

494,"This property has the potential to be rated 5 stars as it’s location and guest rooms are very good but it goes down hill on a number of fronts and the biggest issue is the perceived lack of staff numbers and poor trainingWe arrived in Dubai early in the morning and made it to Barjeel relatively easily (make sure you know exactly where the place is as our taxi driver had no idea as it’s a very small property) at around 9am and unfortunately we were greeted but a completely empty reception and after looking around the property still couldn’t find anyone around. Lucky for us, a security guard of a neighboring site was kind enough to offer help and after about half hour we rang and rang until a butler picked up as he was asleep (at 9am???). He notified the receptionist who finally arrived (really needs training as we felt talking to her was like pulling teeth as she offered no information and we had to keep asking questions) and we weren’t the only ones looking for a check in as another couple arrived soon after (so they can corroborate our story). The receptionist said we can’t check in till eleven (fair enough in a way) but offered little in the way of guidance of what we should do. It was 40c outside and when I asked if she had any brochures on things to do or see there wasn’t much response and after again asking for at least a map of the area (this is our first time to Dubai) found a small map which was pretty useless. I find it extraordinary that a hotel/guesthouse or any serious accommodation wouldn’t provide their guests with some basic tourist guides and info in a foreign place. Anyway we were on our own so we ourselves and the new couple banded together and went out to kill 1.5 hours so we could check in and let me tell you after flying for half a day the last thing one wanted to do is go out in 40c heat in a foreign place with no helpful info from reception on where to go or what to do or even accommodate us temporarily in its restaurant for that time.When we did check in after we suffered in the heat for 1.5 hours (she could of told us there was a shopping centre 500m away) there rooms were good and fairly comfy except there is no cold water (we think the pipes get so hot that the cold water gets warmed) so don’t expect a soothing cold shower post a day out. Another small thing was I talked to the receptionist about our tv not working and she said she will get someone to have a look at it the next day but of course no one arrived (only a small issue as we didn’t come to watch tv but it’s the principle here). The breakfast was well below a normal standard which is very surprising considering there is a big Carrefour around the corner and one could easily supply everything one needs just from there for a breakfast. Overall not a very good experience and we think the guesthouse is being neglected by its parent Heritage hotel and when we asked for an airport transfer it was very hard going and told in no uncertain terms that a driver can swing by Barjeel (from Heritage) at 6.30am after picking up guests from parent hotel and sounded like we were an inconvenience. When asked about taxis all we got was yes they are around (no we will arrange one for you at the time you desire). To be perfectly honest the nice security guide was more of a help as he showed us how to use the metro and was going to take us to the taxi (and he doesn’t even work there). I’m giving it an extra star as the location is excellent right on the water and witching a short stroll to souks and abras to take you across the river.

500,"The hotel is in a great location - approximately 150 meters to the nearest train station (Metro Green Line - Station 24), and immediately outside the front door is Dubai Creek promenade. A short walk away is the Bur Dubai Abra Dock where you can take a traditional dowh (wooden boat) across the river (cost Dh1 per person) to explore the Spice, Gold & Perfume Souks of Deira. There is also an enormous Carrefour Supermarket nearby - extremely handy for stocking up on essential supplies, as well as bottled water and snacks. The rooms are very nicely decorated, but the lighting is very very dull, so don't expect to see clearly (good luck ladies with applying your make-up). Breakfast is adequate. We dined once during the evening and while the taste of the food was lovely, the meals we received were different to what was described on the menu. If a meal is described as being accompanied with salad and chips, that's what should be served - not a couple of shards of carrot on the plate (that's a garnish, not a salad). The quantity of food was also lacking (very small portions for the price). One very frustrating aspect we found during our stay was that Reception was hardly ever manned. The hotel asks that you drop your key at Reception when leaving for your days activities, however each morning we had to search to find a member of staff to leave the key with, and then when returning in the afternoon/early evening, we usually had to search again for a member of staff in order to collect it and gain access to our room. Not a huge issue for us, but some people may find this annoying. We saw guests dropping and collecting keys themselves from the secure holding box. This is a security issue in my opinion! Also, reception is near the hotel's back entrance and if it's unattended it's very easy for someone to wander in from the outdoor public space (locals gather on the grass to enjoy social time) - guests store their bags in reception when checking out early, so that could be a security concern. Overall, we enjoyed our stay - but we don't like the massive manufactured hotels - instead much preferring boutique properties.

This is the only negative thing, and if you know this it is much easier. The hotel is right by the metro station and so close to the Abra dock. We were easily able to explore even staying there for 24 hours. The reason I give this hotel 5 stars is because of their amazing customer service. We were accommodated with arriving early (at 6am) we had to pay a fee of $37 US. But it was the best money we spent as we had been traveling for almost a month and we were ready to rest. They provided us our room, helped carry our bags, and also accommodated us with a very early morning breakfast on the next day when we departed. They allowed us to have our continental breakfast at 6:30am . We were greeted by Kasim (I believe this to be his name) who was beyond friendly and wanting to help us in any way he could. We ate our breakfast and quickly left to find a taxi. Since the hotel is so far from the street we didn't know how to get a taxi and I went back to the hotel while my partner stayed by the luggage. They sent one of their employees to help us hail a taxi. The customer service didn't stop there. I was on the plane back home, hooked up to wifi when i got an email from them a few hours later that told me they had found my iPad in the room. I didn't realize it fell out of my bag. I told them I would pay for them to ship it back. I ended up speaking with the concierge, Abdul Yaseem, at the Arabian Courtyard hotel as it is their bigger sister hotel, and they were very responsive and gave me good directions so that we could get the iPad shipped back. I received it about a week later, and in perfect condition. Abdul even followed up with an email to make sure I received it. I have never had such amazing service and what a ethical job they did to process cash sent and safely shipped my iPad back. It was more than I could have ever expected. I don't think I can praise them enough. I would 100% stay here again if I have a layover in Dubai again. I hope this review holds some weight because they really went so far beyond what I have received in customer service from any hotel previously in my travels. Thank you to everyone who provided a good stay and got my iPad back home to me. Many many thanks! ","October 22, 2016","9    Barjeel Heritage Guest House

They simply don't care about their customers enough and their casual attitude is not in keeping with the intention of the authorities that visitors to the city should be well treated. The management of all the guest houses is through the Arabian Courtyard Hotel so any queries need to go to them rather that to the 'butlers' who don't seem to know their elbow from their backend. Perhaps the Municipality should take their buildings back, put in local managers and run it properly because the current ones are not and it is giving the whole concept a bad name.","January 16, 2016","9    Barjeel Heritage Guest House

515,"This is a unique property in Dubai being a renovated 100 year old house located in the heritage village. This area has a lot of charm located on the banks of Dubai creek near to souks and restaurants instead of freeways and soulless skyscrapers.It was easy to find from airport- take the metro, one change of line hen get off at Al Gubaiba station taking the EAST heritage village exit. The guest house entrance is visible from outside the metro, but there is a secret passageway to reception that's not well marked. Security is lax and anyone can walk in from that back entrance. Location is great, there is a mall and supermarket across the road and if the metro is closed you can get an Abra across the creek for 1 dirham with the locals.Reception were friendly and helpful. Room we not ready so we had lunch in the adjacent restaurant which served tasty food with plenty of local flavours on the menu including camel kebabs. The rooms are Spartan but are in traditional style and comfortable. They are let down by cleaning with dirty toilet rim, mouldy shower and dusty bed cover clearly noticeable. The bar fridge also needed a clean out from a bad smell.There is complete darkness inside with old style windows and lock and key door (which poses a fire hazard if someone locks you in from outside). But if you want to sleep in, this is not the place as staff were going about their business in the open courtyard clearly audible from the room.In summary this guest house does not have the standards or comforts of a chain hotel but if you are a forgiving traveller, it makes up for that in charm and character - both of which is hard to find in Dubai.","December 31, 2015","9    Barjeel Heritage Guest House

It was located in a perfect location for easy access from the train station and the rooms were cool and clean. Although you could eat at the restaurant, which we did, there were a number of places within walking distance where you could also purchase amazing meals.

517,"Stayed 3 nights in Old Dubai after a business trip, and wanted to get a flavor of a traditional Arabian guest house, after staying in a chain hotel. The Barjeel Heritage Guest House is situated in a historic part of Old Dubai. Great part of its location is that it is literally steps away from a Metro station (Al Ghubaiba). My room was spartan (includes bathroom), but very comfortable, off a charming courtyard. There is a restaurant onsite, where I had breakfast (included in my room charge) -- pleasant dining area, but I was the only one there each morning (I like to eat early, and see the sights). Breakfast was strictly Western style for guests (though, there is a sign board outside which advertises traditional Arabian breakfasts!) Restaurant overlooks the Dubai Creek. Lots of street activity outside -- joggers, families strolling, at all hours of the day -- great local color. I would definitely recommend staying here if one wants a different experience from the boring, chain hotels in modern Dubai. This location was extremely convenient as I booked local tours, and made my way to nearby destinations.","November 24, 2015","9    Barjeel Heritage Guest House

Breakfast was equivalent to a 2 star hotel.

The location is excellent and the architecture of the guesthouse gives you an idea of Arabic culture before the skyscrapers took over the city. The rooms are very nice and have all amenities one can ask for - the breakfast needs to be pre-ordered the evening before which gives you a little less flexibility but it's worthy as it is really good! The staff was very welcoming and flexible and if you hang around a bit you will meet very interesting people who are staying long time at Barjeel and are open for a chat.

522,"We had originally booked and paid to stay at Ahmedia Heritage Guest House, but despite our advance booking and payment it was full so they transferred us to another guest house in their chain, Barjeel Heritage Guest House.This proved to be an excellent place to stay with a wonderful location right beside Dubai Creek and 2-3 min from a Metro and bus station. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was excellent and served overlooking Dubai Creek. We had two other meals at the excellent restaurant.It is located next to the (yet to be completed) Dubai Heritage Village and provides a welcome change from international chain hotels and modern places that look the same regardless of where they are. Nice design and touches to reflect the local culture, and excellent local food too.Although we had booked a family room with one double and two single beds, we got a room with two large double beds, which proved to be ok. The room was nicely furnished with a fridge, art, tea/coffee facilities, air con and a large, modern bathroom. The free Wi-Fi was excellent.The guest house had a nice courtyard area, but given the high temperatures (max 46 deg C each day), an air conditioned lounge would have been nice.I have no hesitation recommending the guest house and its restaurant.","August 9, 2015","9    Barjeel Heritage Guest House

538,"If you want to stay somewhere with character and with easy access to ""old Dubai"" the Barjeel Guesthouse is really worth trying. It has a lot going for it - a scenic location on Dubai Creek, its own (very reasonably priced & high quality) restaurant, a stone's throw from the metro & a 5 minute walk to some of the old souks. We thought they had 24 hr check-in, but when we arrived at 6am we were told that we would have to pay AED 150 to check-in early. However, we didn't regret paying extra because we'd had an overnight flight & it allowed us to have a rest before going out to explore. If you have small bags it is very easy and cost effective to take the metro from the airport. Beware of ""taxi"" drivers approaching you in the airport. A driver offered to take us to the guesthouse for AED 150. When I said that I'd heard the fare should be AED 25 he just walked away. Having said that, when we got in the taxi at the rank just outside customs, there was a flag fall of 25 and another 25 fare to get to the guesthouse. We were very satisfied with the guesthouse and will certainly recommend it to friends.","October 1, 2014","9    Barjeel Heritage Guest House

560,"i have to book the villa for 6 people , but we managed to be 3 people in a three bedroom villa. it was one of the amazing times that i sat in such place. the things i want to highlight are : -its a place where you can feel that you are in a heaven.-the location is great as you can go and come to Jumairah and Sh Zayed road. - the best time to visit is winter when you can stay outside in the garden for a breakfast or an afternoon tea. moreover, you can visit anytime. - the design is simple and comfortable.-place is clean.-i like that you have a parking in side the villa with a remote control. -a credit in my review is if you have a driver , he has a room as well and you can use it for the helper as well. (house-made)- i preferred if they were having a small pool adding to the overall design and preference but again its nice if you are always outside the villa exploring Dubai. -If you are having a party, its fine to tell them so the night shift security will note down that. as a result, you need to make sure on the number of the guests who are staying overnight (not more than 6) as they have will rise a complaint and will charge you on that more higher than if you agreed before hand.","September 1, 2016","12    Roda Boutique Villas

The simple structure although sophisticated villas is part of the joyful time I spent there. 3 bed rooms and living room kitchen 3 bathrooms. Beautifully designed with lavish furniture.

564,"Roda villas are located in a quiet and relatively isolated place in Umm Sequiem area of Jumeirah. I lived twice in one of them since I was a wedding guest on two occasions. My view could be biased because the wedding house was located very close to the villas and hence any small inconvenience may have been ignored.The structure of the villa is standard. There is a portico and living room on the ground floor, with a kitchen, bathroom and a washing area.The top floor has three rooms of varying sizes. The master bedroom is really huge, while one room is tiny with a queen sized bed, while the other has twin beds.The entire villa is air-conditioned and well-maintained. There is no room service and apart from a soft drinks and fruits there is not much to eat. The area is isolated so far away from the din of the city, the disadvantage of it being there are zero shops, malls or supermarkets in the vicinity. If you want to get some food in the middle of the night, home deliveries are the only option.This option is suitable for large number of guests, preferably from the same family or community. Trying to fit in different types of nationalities would be a difficult proposition.The rates are fairly steep but it is worthwhile if you stay close to the area.","December 16, 2015","12    Roda Boutique Villas

At check out, they came for the usual inspection, we had some minor damages (few burn wholes on the sofa, damaged towels ) and we were supposed ot pay for the damages but they waived the charges out of courtesy which was brilliant, and very unexpected. im very happy with their service and I highly recommend them.contact Kosta Adamakis 00971 55 542 0279 and he will take care of everything for you, just like he did with me.","October 10, 2015","12    Roda Boutique Villas

573,"We-daughter,wife and self had to make a trip to the beautiful city of Dubai in August this year in connection with my daughters enrollment for higher studies in a college of repute there.Groping in the dark as to how to go about finding some decent budget accommodation we hit the Trip Advisor trail for some useful info and as always, found some spots in Burj Dubai having a large South Indian population.After going into some details available about the Hotels,we zeroed in on Hotel Vasantham and made a tele booking of our requirement which was efficiently handled by the front office Manager,Mr Shashi.Landing at the Dubai International Airport and moving to the exit was an experience by itself.Courtesy and efficiency was felt at every point.The next activity was to get hold of a Taxi to take us to the Hotel.Just at the head of a quick moving queue waited a Lady Taxi driver who efficiently and very kindly took us to our Hotel and didnt charge a fil more than what was showing on the meter.Maybe assessing that we were in Dubai not for holidaying,she even suggested that we learn to travel in buses and the Metro.Tucked inside a bye lane off Al Nadha Street the Hotel didnt boast of a grand entrance,yet was very modest fitted with a sensor based door mechanism.The check-in formalities were completed in about 5-6 minutes with our Passports being scanned and we were ushered to our room in a noiseless non wobbling elevator. The room was large enough for the three of us and was very fresh-with linen changed ,toilet sanitised etc.The A/c was very efficient with a control mechanism inside the room.The room had a cupboard equipped with a mini Fridge and safe.The toilet was fairly spacious with a bath tub.Since it was only two in the afternoon we hit upon exploring Burj Dubai and bang came near the famous Saravana Bhavan restaurant.Finding it difficult to ignore,we decided to have lunch and moved on.After going around the Burj Dubai area we realised that we had made an excellent choice for our stay as we were very close to the Al Ghubaiba Metro Station as well as the Bus station.Soon neared the day for us to return and we realised how soon our thirteen day stay was coming to an end.The last few days of our stay was mostly spent inside the room as the temp outside was nearing 45 degrees celsius.Evenings were spent watching the small boats sailing in the water way in Burj Dubai.Although the Hotel has a good restaurant we didnt frequent the same as we were experimenting with various options available.It was departure time and we had to check-out.Warm as he is, our check-out was hassle free efficiently handled by Mr Shashi.I would strongly recommend this Hotel to business travellers as well as families.","September 25, 2014","14    Vasantam Hotel

613,"I am currently backpacking South East Asia, but Dubai was my first stop. Accommodation is expensive in this part of the world, but finding an affordable hostel was easy.At the time, I thought all hostels are little hut bungalows by the beach (blame mu enthusiasm for Bali Instagram posts), so I was shocked to find it was on one floor of a 14 story building. The hostel is located in a red light district. You won’t see any uncouth activities going on, but I saw loads of passport photo sized pictures of women advertising themselves and signs saying “no loitering”.I arrived quite late at night but there were staff there to check me in. You are given a security card to open your room.The bed was comfortable and I had a privacy curtain.I was given a small locker to keep my valuables in. I kept my backpack under my bed.The hostel serves a VERY nice breakfast. So nice that it skewed my later expectations of hostel breakfasts. Think: sausage omelettes, toast with loads of spreads, fruit, juices and hot drinks. You have to pay extra for breakfast though.The showers could be improved: there is a bathtub come shower that was very dirty but it’s ok if you have flip flops.The social aspect was very good. I met a lot of people on the first night who I still talk to. There are always people going out at night to the nearby bars and clubs. Everyday is ladies night in Dubai. Overall it was not a bad baptism to backpacking or to dorms.","February 19, 2019","16    BackPacker 16

They just showed me all their rooms almost in the middle of the night! so they have 6-beds in a room- 50 ($15) aed per night option and an executive room - 189 ($ 50) aed per night - which is not bad at all, it has a double bed and own attached bathroom, a shared kitchen with another private room. What I liked about this hostel? The staff! They do surprise me with the sincere hospitality and pro approach though J told them I just want to have a look and might not stay!

I thought that was bad enough... but then i was woken at 5am and 6am to a man coming into my room and talking to the girl on the bottom bunk very loudly (its a female only dorm).The room was an absolute state, the girl below clearly lived there and had taken over the small amount of room that was there, including the whole wardrobe and the window ledge, and the whole space under the bed, i had nowhere for my things. I also had no plug for my devices, even though the website stated that every bed has a plug and a night light.... thats a lie. The whole area was a mess, the floor was awful i never took my shoes off. The final straw for me was housekeeping trying to break into the bathroom when i was getting a shower!!The bathroom was also a mess, stuff everywhere, no toilet roll until someone put it back there in the morning, floor was soaking, i kept my flip flops on to get in my interrupted shower.I complained to the staff and they told me they had already had complaints about my room and the girl living there... i asked for my second night to be refunded as i wouldn't be staying, they refused.This is the most pathetic hostel i have ever stayed in, and i travel alot!

635,I have been coming to Dubai for the pay 25 years and watched it grow. This area of this hotel is the best are for budget. You are 5 min away from the main road where the tallest building is 15 /20 min from the airport so location is great. They have free WiFi and some free bus service. Every where is clean and service is great. ,"December 2, 2017","18    Winchester Grand Hotel Apartments

636,I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights. We booked a studio apartment. The room was clean and quite big with washing machine and basic utensils. The best thing about the hotel is its location. Its a KM away from the Burjuman Metro station and Indian restaurants. The staff was great too we had issues related to the washroom and the AC and the staff showed up almost immediately when we called. Never seen such a prompt service. The breakfast was also decent with enough vegan dishes.,"October 22, 2017","18    Winchester Grand Hotel Apartments

641,"We booked two rooms to accomodate my wife and I plus our sons for a 5 night stay. The rooms come with a small kitchenette but we did not use the facilities preferring to eat out instead. The beds were comfortable, however, some of the furniture could do with being replaced and the decor with some TLC, (tender loving care). For example, the shower curtains looked worn, the tiles around the bath were chipped and not properly filled in. We were disappointed to find that the rooftop pool was not heated and in February when the temperature was in the low 20s (celcius) meant we could not use it. Furthermore, on arrival we found out the gym was closed. The management offerered the use of these facilities at their sister hotel, the Winchester apartment hotel, which was a 5 minute walk away. We did take up this offer on one day, good heated pool and well equipped gym, but not as convenient and therefore not utilised as often as we would have liked.The hotel is situated in the middle of residential flats in a predominantly Indian sub-continent area and is around a 15 minute walk from 3 Metro stations. While this distance was comfortable during the temperatures in February I can imagine it being more challenging if you were to make a number of these walks during in a single day when the temperature exceeds say 30C. The Burjamun local shopping mall has a very good food court offering numerous options at affordable prices as well as many restaurants which are a little more expensive. The free wifi speed of 512kb at the hotel was very slow and in this day and age I would have expected much better, particularly to cater for the younger generation. It would be interesting to know if this is the norm amongst similarly priced hotels.Breakfast options lacked a little in quality, for example, limited bread options of only sliced white and brown bread. It would be better to have a selection of uncut breads. I would have liked a selection of more than one cut fruit available. My wife however did like the Indian options such as the vegetable rice, puri's and samosas.In summary, the hotel staff were always friendly and eager to help, but slow wifi speed and lack of usable pool and gym at the hotel (as advertised) disappointed. It felt more 3 star than 4 star and very unlikely we would choose to stay here again.","February 18, 2017","18    Winchester Grand Hotel Apartments

642,"Given this hotel through Cruise Nation, having no experience of the area foolishlythought if it was allocated as a package through a tour operator it should be okay.After requesting a twin room for myself and my friend 2 females this appeared on all the paperwork, Upon arrival we were allocated a one bedroom apartment (room 109)with a large double bed! which was quite frankly unclean! really grubby is the only way to describe it and obviously very old, advised the bellboy this was unsuitable as we had requested a twin bedded room. He said that the only twin bedded available in the hotel was room 111 which was a studio and would be a downgrade as it did not have a seperate kitchen at which point we were advised we would be due a refund as it did not have a separate kitchen, still not happy but as it did have the required 2 beds we accepted itI emailed Cruise Nation advising our situation and requesting help as we did not want to stay in this hotel. It is not near anywhere, so even if it were clean and comfortable there was no where to eat out or even buy food nearby, so not accessible to any of the places you would want to visit so without using taxis all the time. Really surprised it was in fact used by Cruise Nation as a suitable place to put their clients.

Our room was spacious, so for a day's use it suited our purpose - however the rooms dingy; safe was locked closed when we arrived, shower water was cold (immersion heater didn't work), tv and some lights tripped, and air conditioning control was difficult to operate (again we had to call maintenance). Fitted units were cheap and old, and I wouldn't have dared cook anything in the kitchen. Sheets looked OK, clean white cotton, but I was glad we didn't have to use the bed. Breakfast was a mix of all types of food, adequate. So, as there don't seem to be many hotels in Dubai offering day use, it sufficed - but for overnight stay, look elsewhere!

651,"Arrived at hotel at 9am, they allowed us into our rooms with no extra charge. The rooms weren't quite to our liking, a bit grubby, we asked for a change of rooms, they gave us, without question, new and better rooms, we went from two studio apartments to a one bedroom apartment with an adjoining studio. This was perfect for my friend and I. The rooms were a bit dated and could have had a wee bit more attention to the cleanliness of the kitchen. The staff could not have been more helpful, especially our 'maid' a 23 yr old young man, very nice, I think it would be a good idea for the staff to be doubled up, a lot of work for one person and in twos they keep each other motivated. There is an on site restaurant, wouldn't really like to comment, as we never went in, phoned room service once and was told there was nothing much to offer, not even plain ice cream, but according to room menu, there was a lot of choice??The view from any window was like every other view in dubai, of other buildings. The shops, in the millions, are just around the corner on a main street. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to quite a few attractions, very handy, comfortable and reliable. There is a rooftop pool, very nice. There is also a sauna, gym and hot tubs, all very clean. There is always staff in these areas. The hotel is very quiet, i mean you cannot hear other peoples noise, there was quite a lot of guests there. The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in and huge. They have blackout curtains which definitely work.Anything we asked for, we got.

657,This hotel isn't in the best location and there is nothing to do in the local area but it's easy enough to get a cheap taxi into town and it's fairly close to the airport. The check in took a little longer then necessary and after selecting a non smoking room with balcony . We were given a room that smelt of smoke and no balcony. We were tired after a long flight and just wanted to head out and the room was nice enough - so we didn't raise the issue. Another issue was that when we asked for water we were told the restaurant had no bottles left...not ideal so my husband got directed to the shop only to find two bottles in the room. The room was clean spacious and comfortable but no decent views from the rooms. We found this room on special offer and paid about £50 which I think was fair for services and quality.

666,"So i stayed at the Winchester Grand 5 years ago when i first got married. I fell in love with Dubai and couldnt wait to return. I rebooked this hotel this year (now we have two kids) due to the location and more importantly the shuttle bus as many other hotels i was looking at did not offer this service.Upon arrival, i struggled with my luggage, i had 3 large pieces and 2 strollers. No one helped and they only realised what i was doing when i was wobbling around trying to juggle my luggage; the taxi driver did honk continuously to indicate new arrivals but this was expected as the staff are not very attentive from what i remember last time.I arrived early and they allowed me early check in but i also had to pay a city tax charge which was introduced in 2014. I was also asked to pay a deposit of 240 dirhams which was lucky that i had exchanged enough otherwise i wouldnt have been able to. I wish they would let people know earlier on their website about this.We went to our room and it was literally the same layout/furniture as when we last stayed. Nothing had changed. Nothing. Which on the face of it isnt a bad thing but means it is quite dated and could do with a freshen up. The shower/bath is quite muggy, the toilet seat being loose, some other kids have drawn all over the walls, kitchen wasnt that clean, fridge was dirty etc. It was just old and used. The bed was average, i couldnt sleep too well as im used to a soft bed and this was quite hard.The shuttle bus service is a great attraction to this hotel. It takes you to the popular destinations/areas for you to explore. I enjoyed good chats with the driver and he seemed a very nice guy.We didnt eat at the hotel as we ate alot at JBR and Dubai Mall so cant comment on the food.The security guard was a very nice chap, he was more helpful then the staff behind the desk who were very disinterested. I booked a excursion with the lady in the foyer and she tried to charge me 100 dr for my 3 year old child which was extortionate! Many other companies charged way less than this but to her credit, after a few words she managed to get him free. The excursion was absolutely epic.The area the hotel is situated in is heavily populated with South Asian ethnicities. This was the case when i last came but now it has become like x5. Just a bit of information.The cleaning maiden was very polite and a nice guy, when i asked for my room to be cleaned and not to be disturbed he did so. Pool was okay. Nothing special. Spent most of the time in the kids pool. No complaints.Gym was good too. Had majority of the basics so you can work out on what you would do at home. The equipment is basic and dated but still good enough to use. Just hard to do so in the heat!The is a couple of supermarkets located around the corner. Metro Al Fahidi 10 minutes walk away. Burjaman Mall about 20 minutes away. If you can do it, you can walk to the creek in about 45 minutes and see all the souks. So the amenities around are great. The view from the hotel is terrible but then again its a city hotel and you cant see much. Just beware that there is something being built directly opposite the hotel and they do work all night as i could hear thing clanging around throughout the whole AM for the whole two weeks.Would I come back to Dubai again? Yes definitely. Would I return back to the Winchester Grand? No. Think this was the last visit here for me and next time i will stay more around the Marina side.","September 22, 2016","18    Winchester Grand Hotel Apartments

We were thrilled and so great full for our free upgrade on our second trip. Our room was great! The only reason why we haven't given five are just small issues - you often have to leave notes or request a top up on loo roll, turn away housekeeping if they're early and for the bin to be emptied in the kitchen (easily forgotten as they're all stored away). Other than those minor issues, we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you to all of you and see you again soon! ","August 15, 2016","18    Winchester Grand Hotel Apartments

It is situated in ""the Greens"" area of the city which is one of the few locations which has a sense of community with grassed areas, ornamental lakes and a number of shops, restaurants and supermarkets. Bars are only available in hotels in Dubai and the nearby Byblos Hotel has a typical English bar called the The Crown and Lion with weekly entertainment and great tv sports coverage.The main beaches and attractions are a short taxi drive away and taxis here are plentiful and very cheap. For example, a ten minute taxi to the popular Barasti Beach Bar is less than 20 dirhams ( about £4).The apartments themselves are quite large and very well maintained. We had a one bedroom which was spacious and well equipped with full kitchen, dishwasher and washing machine. It had a large comfortable diner / sitting area with two sofas and flat screen tv which had many channels including all premier league soccer games! Air con was also very good.there was also free wifi in the room.The apartments also had access to a well maintained outdoor play area with swimming pool, basketball court and multi sports area.There was also a well equipped gymnasium next to the pool.

706,"After two months of staying here, two of the front office staff made a perfectly pleasant trip into a blood pressure raising experience by being completely unapologetic and uncourteous about an extended housekeeping delay. They kept negating whatever I said and went to the point of arrogance where I had to walk off after telling them to do whatever they wanted in order to save myself from any further insulting behavior they could have thrown my way. I had already been told that I keep interrupting when they are trying to explain (I wasn't as I know their entire explanation by heart now) and that I'm lying. You'd expect an apology at least when any delay is caused by a hotel. But i think the two members of the front staff are too proud for that. And the guests probably too unimportant. My intention of writing this is only in the hope that the management would read this and send their staff on guest relation training of some sort to match their attitude to the luxury of the hotel.I would recommend the stay here if you're OK dealing with crappy attitudes.

Well, it took the whole week that we were there and during that time the staff couldn't give us any answers. The day before we left I was given the hotel manager contacts and when I contacted him and asked for a refund, he didn't even bother to reply.

709,"I originally booked Skai through a third party - booking.com back in Sept, the booking requested payment on arrival. I too had my room cancelled, due to Xmas/NewYear being the busiest time they decided on a deposit they informed Bookin.com of this fact (booking.com have confirmed this did happen) who should have informed me. However I did not receive any notifications from booking.com regarding this. I found out by chance!!! I immediately contacted Skai direct who informed me they were now full. On our booking this was NOT Skai Residency's fault but lack of communication from the third party! Skai Residency were brilliant when they realised what had happened and as soon as a cancellation came through they rang me direct even though it was 3am Dubai time, they even upgraded my room at no extra cost because the cancellation was a larger room than I booked. I could not have asked for a better response. I can only speak for myself as to the reason for the near disaster I so nearly encountered & felt I needed to clarify that Skai Residency were not to blame for my incident & others may have suffered the same fate due to a third party. Now for the review: The Residency is in a residential area ( I choose here to be near family) but taxi's are really cheap they are passing on a regular basis. This is a serviced apartment, people should not expect hotel treatment that is not what they are selling or providing!! Reception Staff were great really pleasant & hospitableThe rooms are spacious with plenty of storage & really comfy beds!!! Bathrooms are large & well appointed. I was pleasantly surprised to find complimentary toiletries & even more surprised to have my apartment cleaned EVERY day, remember this is not a hotel! The lounge had TV with English programmes & FREE wifi (better than a lot of hotels), comfy settee large table & chairs & a well equips kitchen if you wished to eat in. Washing machine, kettle pots pans etc are also provided. The whole residency was spotless & great value for money. I would highly recommend it if you have family on the Greens I was over to see family with a new baby & friends all living in the area.Nice pool & garden areaWithin walking distance is the "" village"" with a couple of local eating places, a Costa, well equipt Supermarket, Ice Cream shop, cash points, fast food etc & a lovely little grassy area with a lake great for a nice walk. I would definatly stay again when visiting family/friends - if It was a luxurious holiday I was after I would book a hotel - horses for courses as the saying goes!!! My advice is book direct & pay a deposit to be on the safe side & a special mention & thankyou to Jamacia (reception) for helping me out with the cancellation. :-)","January 6, 2014","19    SKAI Residency

710,"We had booked a room for my parents to stay near us over the festive period. They were coming to meet their new baby granddaughter. The only reason we chose this place was because it was close- despite the fact we had stayed before and not been overly impressed. I was organised and booked the room in early Sept so the rate was ok. The hotel saw I had a good rate over a peak period and simply cancelled my booking and resold it 11 days before my parents were due to arrive. They gave me some blatantly dishonest excuse about my credit card ( the same 1 used to book the room previously). They didn't make any attempt to contact me. By this time the surrounding hotel rates are now 5x what we were due to pay and out of budget. This has been very stressful and severely altered our plans to enjoy having visitors over Christmas. It would appear the company's greed comes ahead of customer service. Speaking to the manager on the phone- he was rude, dishonest and hung up on us. I hate to leave bad review but would hate to know other people could go through the stress we have been through.","December 13, 2013","19    SKAI Residency

Under the bed was filthy with dirt and dust looked like it had been forgotten about by the cleaner. - Bed sheets were filled with dust when we asked boy (saying no staff only 1 in the floor) if we could have them changed he replied: ""well the cleaner has finished. very bad ...whos going to do it?"" - Fridge was dirty and horrible and the bottom of it was rusty. - Staff funny when you leave hotel to eat or drink out.

741,"As management consultant, I travel a lot and I have seen many hotels in Dubai. This one is exceptionally bad for the reasons listed below:1. Their ""free"" internet is incredibly slow. You will barely manage to update your email or run google search. For the decent internet they charge money (50 AED per day). Absolutely unacceptable for business travelers. 2. Room cleaning is horrendous. I found things that belonged to previous guest and during room cleaning they did not change my bed sheets or provided second towel. 3. They do not provide basic necessities that every hotel has, like toothbrushes or soap bars.4. Water in the hotel is barely warm ( the weather outside during my stay +37 degree, so this was really surprising) 5. Hotel is extremely old - facilities are outdated and I found mold in my room (it is unsanitary)6. During my stay the only treadmill in the hotel was in non-working condition. 7. When I tried to escalate all these issues to the management, the hotel staff ignored me for 5 days until I complained to DTA.Overall - do not waste money for this hotel.

Upon checkin receptionist was so rude whereas lady duty manager was so polite and offered upgrade to suite room. During winters, Pool was not heated so we had to leave as it was very cold. We ordered food from room service, the portion was very generous with reasonable prices. Breakfast not really nice, not many options and staff was only focusing on clearing the tables rather than focusing on service. Staff has poor knowledge, we went to the bar and asked the waitress to put the bill in the room as we were in-house guest and we had deposit, she replied that they only accept cash or credit card.

760,"Went to this hotel in September and it was actually better than i thought it would be. The room given was spacious and clean. They have a nice rooftop pool which is quiet! Good for relaxing. The beds are Comfortable giving you a good nights sleep. There wasn't much noise from the locker room or the sports bar. The Morning/Afternoon staff are wonderful especially Lyn. Shes wonderful, If you need anything she will help you out no problem and actually seems like she wants to help you and make things better. Possibly the best receptionist ive ever come across. The breakfast could do with more variety however it was good enough for my stay. Also, the breakfast staff are lovely and polite. They have a '5GB' Wifi limit per device (max 2) in your room which i thought ran out alot quicker than 5GB usually would, however i got this reset by speaking to the reception. The late evening/early morning staff are terrible. Honestly if you have a problem wait till the morning. They are unhelpful, so rude and act like they own the hotel. One of the receptionist (Faizan) tried to 'do me over' and make me seem like i was dumb but when i returned with email evidence from the hotel he had no choice but to sort the problem out for me.Anyways apart from the problem with the late evening/early morning staff evening else was perfectly fine. Its a very good location so close to the metro too. Would definitely stay again.","October 2, 2017","20    Golden Tulip Al Barsha

765,"This hotel, certainly at the rate I paid, represents fantastic value for money for a convenience one night stay. The room was mainly clean and well presented. The staff were all universally friendly, pleasant and efficient. In this area I can't imagine a better choice in terms of value for money. The hotel is within walking distance of the metro and there is enough shade for this to be done even in early summer months. Taxis are easy to find outside. There is also free underground parking, but the entrance is not easy to spot as it is not well signed at the road.The breakfast was standard for the UAE in this type of hotel, but certainly not bad. Service was friendly and the food fresh.My only complaint is that I requested a non-smoking room and, although there was a small plastic sign on the table in the room to identify the room as such, the room smelled very much of stale cigarette smoke. So much so that my shirt left to hang over night smelled of smoke when I put it on in the morning. Not sure whether this was smells through the AC or older usage of the room, but this would prevent me as a 'never-smoker' staying longer.","May 20, 2017","20    Golden Tulip Al Barsha

766,"I can't tell that this hotel is good because I had a bad experience since I reached.When I booked my room I could chose: double bed or two single beds. So, if they allow you to chose, it is because they have both options and they will book for you the one you chose. We reached the hotel and the guy in the reception said us that they didn'tt have avaliable a room with double bed. I said him that I didn't understand it because I booked specifically this bed and it was avaliable.The answer was: ""The hotel is full today but I will compensate you with a upgraded bedroom. We will join the beds and it will be like a big bed""I said him that I was really disapointed because they shoud book the correct bed for us, or don't give us that option If it was not avaliable... For me, one bedroom 5 square meters bigger is not a compensation in this case.He said us that the next day we would change the room to the one we booked, lower level but with the big bed. I explained him that it would be a waste of time and really unconfortable for us because we would have to pack again everything and move. He said that we would have to proceed like this. He didn't try to fix the situation in a better way. Simply with 5 square meters the first night, and changing the room making us to move everything again... Then I wanted to keep a claim and the guy didn't allow me!!! Incredible...Then we went to the room. We were waiting while one guy was joining the beds. My husband expected something different in the way to join the beds ""to make them same as a double bed"", but they simply kept the beds beside each other, even one was little higher than the otherone!. My husband called to the receptcion and he asked for the manager dutty time, they informed us, we cutted the call and after 1 minute they called back. It was more than 1.30am and, on theory, someone cancelled a room just that moment!!!! And exactly the room that we booked! Same level, same bed. Come on... We changed the bedroom so we went to sleep after 2.00am... On the other hand, the room we got was neat and confortable. Only the smell was little bad, like moisture. About the breakfast, we tasted a cake and small muffins which were really hard... Not fresh. There were some kind of bread of lot of days before. Same with the cheese slices...The croisants and napolitanas were fresh. Fruits: they offer watermelon and melon, and fruit salad.Two kind of cheese and turkey, two kind of cereals.Cold mezza and some hot things like sausages, boild eggs, french toasts... You can eat toasts but only with jam or honey. I didn't see butter nor nutella or chocolate. The location is good but arround the hotel you have to pay for the parking, not too much but you have to save coins for it. Summarize: they have to improve the organisation, the way in which they solve the problems, the smell in the rooms, and take care about the things I mentioned in the breackfast. Too much things...","May 17, 2017","20    Golden Tulip Al Barsha

He was very rude and didnt payed attention how to talk. When we got to the room we recieved complimentary (fruits), due to a long check-in. Later on recieved a call for an additional payment, as was mentioned it was for a security deposit. It was very weird for a hotel, and it wasnt mentioned on a booking. When I was about to pay I had to go down as their machine was broken, same guy said that we need to move to another room cause they have maintanence, so we had to pack again for a moving.

Charged 170 Dirham for airport collection, car was a dirty Toyota, dropped off in the Golden Tulip bus with a driver that thought he was a racing driver. save your money and get collected from a normal taxi at half the price 2. Hotel staff were rude, unhelpful and not professional 3. Air fresher throughout the lobby and lift that stinks 4. AC unit noise, I switched it off and open the window 4.

They only serve filtered coffee for breakfast that is so nasty you cant drink it, I asked for a cappuccino and was told there would be charge for it 6.

Used the pool upstairs, is was dirty with broken tiles, sauna changing rooms had broken toilets, very poor hygiene 8 Bathroom in room was dirty , mold in shower area and broken tiles, 9.Towels were hard, excessive use, you would get better conditions staying at a cheap motel travel lodge on the freeway 10.

It's very close to Mall of Emirates and is roughly about 20 mins to city center.2. Though it's a budget hotel the hotel is very well maintained and decor is tasteful n chic. Rooms n bathrooms are far more spacious than some of the more famous brands. We stayed in the superior kingroom and will strongly recommend it. The only downside is that it only has shower n not a bath.3. Room service is prompt, though we didn't need kuch of it. 4. All standard room amenities are present. 5.

818,"I booked this hotel for three nights. I arrived at the hotel around midnight and there was no bell boy or anyone else to help me with my luggage. I had to carry my own luggages into the hotel after a tiring flight. And at the reception I produced all my booking slips and reference numbers but they took close to one hour to do my check in. I made the booking through booking.com and they initially said they don’t have a booking. And after doing several rounds with my passport to their managers office in and out and after passing my passport from one reception officer to another, they managed to check me in. It was a disaster! One gentleman in the reception was apologetic about the delay and I accepted it gracefully and walked into the room. After walking into the room I realized that I’m not given the room I was promised at the time of making the booking on booking.com. The room description mentioned that it had a bathtub but the actual room I was given did not have any bathtub and was smaller compared to the size. Then I went all the way down to the reception and inquired about it. Their response was unbelievable. The gentleman who checked me checked the system and said that they don’t have that type of room at the moment and that’s why I’m given a different room. But I showed them room description and explained why I should get the promised room. Then the duty manager or the front office manager named Pablo walked to the counter and said that they are not in a position to give the promised room and it’s an error of the booking.com site to mention that the room has a bathtub. Then he offered to give me a room which has twin beds and a bathtub. And he was not the least apologetic or polite. He’s the most rude hotelier I’ve come across in my life. The point I’m trying to make here is that it’s not about the bath tub. It’s about keeping its word as a reputed hotel chain and delivering what you promise. And if you can’t deliver what you promise, you need to at least be polite and a tad bit apologetic about it. We pay for the service. ‘Pablo’ specifically will run down your hotel. Very bad customer service. I was not given what was promised at any point during my stay.","February 13, 2019","22    Courtyard By Marriott Al Barsha, Dubai

819,"[I hereby suggest everyone who reads this NOT to sign the breakfast bill.]Stayed in Dubai for 2 months for business trip, tried out various hotels in Al Barsha (near Mall of the Emirates), think i could have some say among them. I'd rank them as Hilton Garden Inn, Holiday Inn, Time Oak, Mena, Marriot Courtyard. For Marriot Courtyard, the last one on the list, i always wanna try it out, cos it looks so new. When i checked in, the staff told me it's only 3 months old, ie opening in Oct/Nov 2018. The lobby is very nice. In room, though, i got an executive room already, which is not the cheapest one. The electric plug on desk is alrdy worn, one on floor with fake cover falls down, toilet flush would spill onto ur leg, and.... when i blowdry my hair in the morning, the tv turns on itself (luckily it's not at night). The worst experience is, when i went for breakfast which is incl in my payment, they insist i must sign a bill, with dollar amount, saying i need not pay even if i sign, and everyone does that. It's their finance's requirement. I refuse and tell them i've checked out already, and they immediately panic and call front desk. (wht da?)And still i insist there's no way i'd sign it. It has a dollar amount on it, it's not Zero nor a simple confirmation that i've taken my breakfast. Wht's the diff from me signing for a not-included lunch etc? Which i actually have to pay for?To answer your question: i need not pay even if i sign? everyone does that? -- there are many people around the world, signing contracts without having a close look, that fall into traps/scams and fail to claim back their money. I'm not gonna be one of them. Others can feel free to, not me. Turn out i just go back to their front desk, scold them, and they let me take my breakfast without signing.","February 10, 2019","22    Courtyard By Marriott Al Barsha, Dubai

822,"First impression you came in to the hotel is people who smile and warm welcoming you by eyes! Such a great beginning! From check in during all our short stay everyone was ready to help. Ms Nima check us in and show excellent hospitality to finish all formality fast and show us the room by her own, it was a nice gesture from her side. As well during the evening she and her colleagues assist us to scan and print some documents, there is a small business center corner with all necessary facilities. As for the hotel it is very new, very fresh with good rooms conditions. All room facilities working in proper way and amenities placed on your arrival. Upon any request we called operator and everything was delivered with in 10 min maximum. Pool and Bar in rooftop very cosy and have good view. By night time it’s very relaxing to stay up and listen light music. In general Hotel is very good, with good location near Emirates Mall and people who work there let guest feel like at home !

824,Me and my husband visit Dubai 2/3 times per year and have stayed in a range of hotels from super fancy (palm island) to absolute budget (in the old town). We like Marriott because of the loyalty program so decided to try this new hotel... it’s amazing! The Filipino guy who checked us in was fab! He explained everything in such detail and offered recommendations (we are difficult to please being Dubai veterans!). All the staff we encountered in the hotel were great but the front of house team were stars - everyone from the bell boy to the senior manager (think his name was Mustafa- great guy!!). The hotel is really well located right next to the emirates mall and metro station. We will never book anywhere else in Dubai after staying here - well done Marriott!,"January 17, 2019","22    Courtyard By Marriott Al Barsha, Dubai

We can’t open the car doors to get off because the space is really tight, have to go wrong way to the basement because the car can’t fit in the space which leads to B2. They don’t clean the rooms properly, also have to be reminded several times to clean the room On top of everything hotel staff is also not good!

826,"The best thing about this hotel is its location, otherwise the hotel could use a bit more improvement in many aspects.The finishes and material was clearly built on a tight budget. A bit too flimsy.There was no hot water quite a bit of time but then it was ok.The card slot by the door to turn on the lights was loose, so it kept disconnecting very often and had to wiggle it a bit to make it work again.The staff were nice, but I think they weren't attentive enough. They wanted to charge me for wifi even though it was free for my room, and they deactivated my key at noon despite asking for late checkout when I arrived.Very little inconveniences, nothing major, and the stay was overall ok. But when they are too many, they count.","January 10, 2019","22    Courtyard By Marriott Al Barsha, Dubai

827,"This was one of the newest Marriott properties in Dubai so as a frequent traveler and Marriott loyalist, I wanted to check it out hoping to enjoy the new facilities. But I have to admit that I was thoroughly disappointed with their facilities.I was here for 4 nights and the shower had a lot of leaks. The entire bathroom was flooded with water. I asked the hotel management to help resolve it. They tried but didn’t fix the issue as I had to ask them each morning after shower to take a look at the issue. After a couple of days of trying they said I didn’t know how to take shower. Besides being rude, they were completely wrong. We met with an engineer from Marriott on the last day of my stay who agreed that the door and other sealants were not proper and were causing leaks. I had to hop out of water puddles each morning while taking shower. I wasted so much time trying to fix their hotel issues that it left me very disappointed. DEFINITELY not coming back and request all readers to checkout many other great Marriott properties in the area including the Sheraton at Mall of Emirates (couple of blocks away).In other things, the insulation of windows is extremely poor. You can hear all the traffic noise from street in wee hours of the morning. It woke me up on several nights after going to bed. Including a picture of the view from my room (notice how close it is to a busy street). I wish the hotel management cared a bit more about taking care of the hotel per Marriott standards.","December 6, 2018","22    Courtyard By Marriott Al Barsha, Dubai

My twin room was near the lifts and not very soundproof and had an adjustment room that i could hear all conversations from mine.The water in the showers could be hotter. Breakfast was great. Great Service from staff was great esp Musa who worked to get me a room. No Bar open yet.Great location a walking distance to Emirates Mall with the metro to move around.

We opened the side drawer and found contraception pills, bloody tissues and a needle and a flight ticket which was a week old. The reception who were no help and unsympathetic so I asked for them to call housekeeping Barkath and Rajesh the supervisors were equally no help. I was told a manager would call to explain the situation, but that has not happened. I was expecting a refund for such a filthy room. Obviously not going to happen. First time air con would not turn off in the room. It was freezing! We called reception who sent someone up who could not turn if off either . Worst sleep ever. Reception were so rude unhelpful.

841,"We spent last weekend at this hotel as we were Christmas shopping in Dubai. We have stayed in Dubai many, many times and have never encountered problems anywhere, however we wanted to try something new for a change. What a mistake. We had issues right from the start when the person checking us into our club room gave us the wrong information about the facilities and our package. And despite paying for an upgrade and being assured we were on the top floor with an amazing view, when we arrived to the room we realised there was no view at all as they’d put us in a room right behind the hotel sign. Not wanting to make a fuss we let it go. Every time we needed something, we had to ring multiple times - we needed extra towels at one point and received pool towels?! On the Friday we woke to no hot water and in the end had to leave the hotel without showering as it was taking too long to fix. Breakfast was sparse and cold, although the poached eggs we asked for separately, and coffees, were perfect. We had a late night and were looking forward to a good sleep - no chance - before 8 am on Saturday there was crashing and shouting outside our window for the the next hour whilst they did maintenance. At this point we called reception and said we were leaving and wanted to speak to the manager. When we got to the front desk we were informed the manager wasn’t in - honestly, the manner in which the person at reception conversed with us about the multiple issues we’d had during our stay was both pathetic and an embarrassment to the hotel, shockingly bad. We were assured the manager, Mr Ehab Maher, would ring or email us that day, but of course we haven’t heard from him. Obviously we have no interest in staying at this hotel again and will certainly NOT be recommending it to anyone we know. For us, having paid a premium to upgrade our stay, it was not value for money at all. ","December 9, 2018","23    Signature 1 Hotel Tecom

847,"We spent 3 nights at the hotel during Eid holidays. I must say that the hotel has a pleasant lobby with colourful ultra modern furniture, which gives you a nice feeling as you enter the property. The front office staff were friendly and efficient despite the very busy time and 100% occupancy. The rooms are decent in size with optimum space use and comfortable beds. With respect to the breakfast, the buffet offers good variety of oriental and continental food. Unfortunately, there are a couple of disadvantages here. The hotel parking is too small offering limited number of slots and is not convenient for big cars. This created a real problem for us to park whenever we leave the hotel and return. Also, the swimming pool is way too small and totally inconvenient for adults. To compare, similar 4 star properties in the same area and within the same price range like Time Oak and Atana offer a much better pool and sunbathing areas. If all what you need is a good room and a good breakfast and you are not visiting the hotel when it is full so you can get an easy parking, then I do recommend Somewhere for you.

(positive)The rooftop pool was very small and there wasn't much room in general.Though, for a low-budget trip it's a good hotel to stay at.","March 19, 2018","23    Signature 1 Hotel Tecom

857,"Checked in on 27th Feb and planning to stay until 5th March. Hotel was recommended by one of my former colleague who had mentioned that their Wood group employees stay here in long term, so I decided check as I’m looking for a hotel room for long term. Checking was smooth and surprisingly room (503) was way specious than supposed to be. Breakfast is very poor, not much options, entrance is very narrow. Submitted laundry and didn’t revive any document in return and moreover laundry did not arrive on agreed date/time. The major disappointment was to finding someone else’s hair in my bathroom “after cleaning service”, looked like hair from a male chest or other areas... and as you can see the cleaning needs to be improved. The corners in a room are dusty. ","February 28, 2018","23    Signature 1 Hotel Tecom

Check in was good and although we were early the room was ready after 15 minutes. The bedroom on the 11th floor was spacious with a very comfortable bed, good linen and pillows. Safe, ironing board, iron and dvd player provided. TV with some English speaking channels. Some tea/coffee supplies but not enough. Housekeeping good. Bathroom looked good but poorly designed. Very limited toiletries, pump action soap, shampoo and conditioner. Towels okay. Water varied in temperature but mainly hot. Annoying sound of extractor fan all night which could not be turned off.Taxis available from the hotel, but beware they offer the hotel cars first which are in the main twice the price of metered cabs.NAY restaurant on mezzanine floor has good food with reasonable prices.","January 31, 2018","23    Signature 1 Hotel Tecom

862,When we were looking at hotels in Dubai we noticed that many were expensive with high taxes. We saw the good rating of this hotel on trip advisor. We were not disappointed. It was close to the airport and not too far from the cruise terminal. There are many restaurants around it and it is across from a shopping centre where the hoho bus is. The metro is literally out the door. The rooms were large and quiet. The breakfast was super with many options available. The only challenge was with the taxi driver who could not find the hotel right away as be said there was a name change. Would definitely stay here again.,"December 12, 2017","23    Signature 1 Hotel Tecom

863,"Stayed between 25 November - 02 December 2017. Location relatively close to Internet City Metro Station. Not too far from Dubai Marina, Mall of the Emirates, Jumeirah Palm, Madinat Souq, Burj al Arab and Jumeirah Beach. Three daily shuttle buses; The Mall of Emirates, Outlet Mall and Jumeirah Beach (see the schedules in the lobby). Very clean and well organized hotel. You can feel at the first sight that the management promoted a close team working spirit and motivation among its employees. The water, coffee, tea, sugar and cream were daily supplied in our room. The trash, bed linen, towels, liquid soap, shower shampoo and hair cream have always been removed, changed or supplemented in proper time. At the buffet, there have been a continuous moves, eyes on all sides, impeccable attitude and outfit, mutual help and smiles. The receptionists - friendly, supportive, competent and concerned to meet customers' demands. All my needs have been immediately resolved without having to repeat any request. Directing to the exit door the bellboys always greeted and welcomed me offering their help to find a taxi, a shuttle bus, a shop, or an exchange office in the area, and so on. We also witnessed some group activities in the lobby: a staff photo session, and the celebration of National Day (2nd of December). Their professionalism has been noticed again. They served us with the anniversary cake (in the colors of the National Flag), dates, juices and a specific national drink whose name I do not remember, and at the end we made a nice group photo altogether. A thrilling moment. For the celebration of the National Day we previously received invitation in out room. Nice place and perfect hosts.","December 7, 2017","23    Signature 1 Hotel Tecom

I would of given it 5 stars but there was one negative experience:The negative side of this Hotel is that the room I stayed did not have an opened window/balcony, and I am a non-smoker who stayed with a friend who smoked. So although there was a working vent, I still had to suffocate basically in a room full of smoke with no place to hide from it. I even asked the staff of how to solve this issue but there was nothing they could do about it. What a pity... So if you are planning to stay in a room with a smoker be aware of that.Other than that I would like to thank the staff for their work and friendliness.

878,"I stayed here for three nights in middle of May 2017. I checked in around 2pm and a room was available. The receptionist said she has upgraded my room to a suite, but when I arrived in the room it was a normal standard room. Overall appearance - the hotel has a clean modern look in the foyer and court yard. The ""Somewhere"" name is clever but I feel they are unable to gain the ""wow"" they are looking for. It is trying to be a boutique hotel but unfortunately it has not worked. Room - too cramped. There is too much furniture for a room this size. Compared to other hotels across the city, it was really small. There is a huge tv on the desk. Bed - amazing. New clean sheets and very comfortable.Bathroom - clean, modern, nice shower in bath. Breakfast - this area is very small. It was chaos on all three days. The staff are attentive and very welcoming. Restaurant - the same area is used for a lunch buffet between 12pm and 4pm. It is advertised as 50Aed but when you pay, it becomes 69Aed, inc service charge. Still a good price. Pool - very small. Not enough for a hotel this size. There are about ten sun beds with parasols. Gym - a good standard for a hotelValet parking - is available if you drive. They were very good and my car returned quickly. Transport - there are enough taxis in the area and the concierge will help you. Always take a yellow Dubai government cabs and not a private.General area - the area is called Barsha Heights, or previously known as Tecom. There are lots of hotels, cafes and restaurants in the area. Almost every place will deliver to the hotel.This place is nice if you get a good deal in the region of 60-80 Gbp a night.

887,"We had a pleasant enough stay at the strangely named Somewhere Hotel. Our room was comfortable with a good, wide bed. The bathroom was good too, though it took a while each time for the hot water to 'kick in'.The room was on the fourteenth floor at the end of a corridor, its only neighbour being the seldom-used emergency stairs. As a result, it was very quiet.Here are a few, small gripes:The lobby is excessively perfumed; we treated it like an assault course to be crossed as quickly as possible!When you enter your room and put your keycard into its slot, the TV comes on automatically - another unwelcome sensual experience!Our stay was let down by poor service. Our room was not cleaned on several of the days we were there. Initially this was because we had unwittingly turned on the electronic 'do not disturb' light. Our first suggestion to ensure room-cleaning would be to avoid the ambiguous electronic system!By our third day, this was sorted and the room well cleaned. However, later in our week's stay, the room was again not cleaned (despite our having left the unambiguous 'please clean' card on the door). The receptionist's response was that the hotel operates an 'every other day' cleaning regime which should have been clear to us when we booked. Whether or not this actually is the hotel's policy, it is not what we expected from a 4-star hotel.As a result of this lack of attention, our supplies of basics such as drinking water and toilet paper were often in jeopardy!Some extra info about the area. Tecom is still being built so parts of it feel like a building site. Our daughter lives in The Greens nearby and we often walked from her home to the hotel and vice versa. It is very pleasant walking in The Greens with its lakes, green verges and gardens, and pavements. Tecom, by comparison, is a somewhat hazardous and unpleasant environment for the pedestrian with few pavements and no attempts as yet to enhance and soften things at street level. There are, however, nice cafes within a few minutes walk from the hotel. Try Manoushe Street or Zaatar W Zeit for Lebanese-inspired breakfasts.","April 3, 2017","23    Signature 1 Hotel Tecom

The sleeping chair was not the best and the quality is dependent upon on the person sleeping in the igloo next to you. I would suggest if your layover is more than 10 hours, look for a hotel close to the airport that has a free shuttle, even with the transit Visa of 50 usd, it would work out cheaper and sleeping or resting may be better.","July 3, 2019","25    Sleep 'N Fly Sleep Lounge

892,"So the thing is when you've been on a long haul flight and you've been sat in economy seats all the way where even the recline makes you sit upright, your body is yearning for a clean flat something to lie on and rest your head and lower back. This is what the pods provide, little more than this. There is noise. They are not sound proofed. You can even hear bags being dragged outside the sleeping lounge area. BUT it's a private place to rest your head, your back and get some time to yourself. It's not a hotel room. Don't expect it to be but it may be just enough for what your body needs. Keep expectations low and you may well be satisfied especially on a time and day when Dubai airport is chaos and packed full.","June 14, 2019","25    Sleep 'N Fly Sleep Lounge

896,"This facility is very helpful if what you need is a quiet and safe place to lay your head in an almost flat 'pod.' The basic units are about 5 foot across and 11 foot deep with a height sufficient to stand. A solid screen is pulled down once you are inside the pod. There seems to be someone ready to awaken you if that is your request. The price is quite cheap at about $10 US per hour. You will be awoken in time for your flight or when you're reserved time comes to an end. There are more expensive units comprising greater space with a regular closing door for those who are willing to pay twice the hourly rate. Those are the pluses...There are some minuses or limitations you must keep in mind. The nearest restroom is about 100 feet outside this business area in a public setting. This can be quite inconvenient if you awaken and need a rest from during a sleep session. There are no showers available. Prepayment is essential even though there always seem to be space when I have used this service. The place is frigid cold and without a blanket it is very uncomfortable. Blankets and pillow, apparently, don't come as part of the service. The attendant at the front desk seems unacquainted with basic English. The noise of people coming and going during your stay seems no more or less then you would experience out in the main terminal. It is critical for you to be absolutely sure which terminal you arriving in and which terminal you are departing since you are certainly a transit passenger. Keep in mind that between concourses you can have as much is a 45-minute hike to get to wherever you need to be. These sleep pods are opposite Gate A, in Concourse A, Terminal 3. If this is not the place from which you will arrive or leave then you may be wasting a great deal of time traveling to/from this rest area.I will be returning to this location but only when I know that it is consistent with my arrival/departure gate/terminal.","January 16, 2019","25    Sleep 'N Fly Sleep Lounge

I once had a 10 hour layover, and just left the airport and stayed at a hotel close by. The Good: Worthwhile if you want to get a couple of hours of rest / get away from the crowds. Anything more than a few hours, I would use the terminal hotel if you need to get actual sleep.The Bad: I have been in summer, and the air conditioning struggles to keep the place cool (unsurprisingly). There is no ambient noise, so you hear everyone else coming in and out of their cabins / pods. I think they could easily put in a white noise generator (or something similar) to muffle those sounds. If you are travelling with kids, then I would also use the terminal hotel, as the sleep'n fly has no individual bathrooms.The staff will check your next flights boarding pass to ensure you can make the connection, and they will wake you up 5 mins prior to the end of your booked time slot.There is room inside both the cabins and the pods to store carry on bags, and charge any devices.","January 5, 2019","25    Sleep 'N Fly Sleep Lounge

Worst was after 3 hours of tossing around , when I finally slept - they put a guy who was snoring like an elephant next to me. Could not sleep a wink. I paid for 6 hours but left after 5. They could have moved him to the end of the pod lineup. It was nearly empty but no one cared even though the snorer kept rest of us awakeI would not recommend for the price. Way too expensive.

The POD seat was all flat and for my understanding very comfortable, the lack of toilets was clearly stated on booking.com website, and the sometimes noise from my neighbours was fine for me.

After checking them out during my 1st visit the 2nd time I booked a pod which reminds me of the business class seats on my Emirates flight my company unfortunately doesn’t book for me, so I had a bit of a business class experience on the ground.

It was noisy, I could hear the call to,prayer and people moving about outside my door and electronic noises which I took I think was the pod doors opening. I had asked for a wake up call and checked twice with the staff member that we would get one. She said we would get a call five minutes before our time was up, which didn’t seem negotiable. In the end someone tapped on our door very quietly about 25 minutes before our time was up and again a few minutes later. I would not have heard the tapping if I’d been asleep, it was so quiet it wouldn’t have woken me! There was a lot of light pollution in the room which didn’t encourage me to sleep.

We then went to get a shower in the terminal but the airport options for showers were not explained to me, although I did ask where they were.

The main con is the fact that there are no toilets in the facility and you have to get up, get dressed and go out into the main terminal and walk 100 yards to a public toilet. The other big con is the add on charges. No pillow or blanket are provided so you have to buy.

918,"I recently had an extended transit at Dubai Airport and thought I share my overall experience at this huge airport. I arrived at A Gates and had a departure from B Gates so I checked the various options available inside the terminal. The 5 star Airport Hotel looked great but was beyond my budget, Snoozecube looked good on the internet but they moved to D gates which was two shuttle train rides away from where I was. The airport information counter referred me to the Marhaba Lounge at either A or B Gates, both apparently have a couple of tube-like sleeping pods which I could have booked on the spot. They looked super comfy, private and spacious but apart from the charge for the pod I also had to pay for the lounge access allowing me access to the buffet and drinks which I didn’t really care about since I was just tired. My final choice was another kind of pod in a sleep lounge called sleep n fly at A Gates in the duty free area. They called them igloo pods and they were kind of an airline business class seat which goes all flat and with a privacy shade. They also have cabins with double beds but for single travellers like me, the pod turned out to be the perfect choice. Mind you, the place is not cheap either, I guess you pay for the convenience of sleeping right in front of the flight gates rather than wasting 2 hours of return travel time to the surprisingly cheap hotels outside the airport. The place isn’t 100% quiet given its location, but it gave me all I needed since I was so tired from my long flight, and I had a good 6 hours of horizontal sleep in relative peace and quiet.","October 30, 2017","25    Sleep 'N Fly Sleep Lounge

The shower kits come with shower sandals and everything you need.So great idea and I would do it again if I had a layover. It felt so much better.I thought the price was pretty good - heaps cheaper than a hotel and no hassle. The staff were great, they even went back to the pod to double check I hadn't forgotten anything.","August 10, 2017","25    Sleep 'N Fly Sleep Lounge

924,"I booked a pod for 4 hoursafter a 12 hour flight, and in anticipation for a 15 hour layover in Dubai. The price is expensive, but try and find a hotel less than $200 USD.The staff was extremely friendly, and I found the pod small but cozy. If you don't like small spaces, don't reserve a pod here. Make sure to bring earplugs and a sleep mask. They will sell you a pillow and blanket, but bring your own. Depending what airline you fly, you may have just gotten yourself one!This pod got me through my rough layover by providing a quiet place to take a nap.

I asked why she did not let me know that there was no room she did not have a reply and she was getting angry I spoke to the sales manager who only justify what the lady said just shooed me away. first time in Dubai I'm facing such an experience and I felt let down by both The reservation staff and sales manager who did not even apologise in case they made a blunder. please do not book this hotel.

931,Staying at the London Creek Hotel is quite acceptable if you are really in to 2 star accommodations. What the hotel promises on its website is not exactly what it delivers in actuality. A few things one needs to note down is the fact that the hotel is not at all close to any convenience stores. Basically an apartment or a studio is only useful if you have groceries and other daily essentials close by. Further to that I will strongly not recommend the property for people who have families as the property is noisy and that will be a problem for quite a lot of people. Other than that it is clean and the breakfast served is quite ok but not really that great. Basically what you pay for is what you get and yes for a Studio or a one bedroom apartment it is quite spacey but you need to know that the property is quite old but maintained well. Another drawback that I found was that the in-house or free wifi is really not that great and I had to tether of my mobile phone for basic emails. I tried one day of paid internet out of my 3 day stay there but then realized that the money sent was wasted because the speed was to slow. Over all I really do not know how to recommend this property but I will not stay there again.,"October 13, 2016","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

932,"This was not what I expected of 3 star accommodation. It was dilapidated and in great need of a overhaul. The shower head fell off, the hair dryer was prehistoric and its reinforced tube was held together with plastic tape, the toilet seat was wobbly, the breakfast was unacceptable and the whole place was depressing. To be fair the staff changed our room but that was only marginally better. I will read my reviews on Trip Advisor more carefully next time. ","September 13, 2016","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

In the bathtub, the only option is to shower as the on top of the faucet is broken and a piece missing enabling the tub to be filled with water. No small face towels. The tile behind the toilet is broken with a large crack and also the douche shower head also leaks and is plugged up with toilet paper I assume to stop the leak. The safe in the closet says ""to reset code push red button on back of safe"".. well, there is no red button!! No material in the room to find out the amenities of the hotel or menu for room service. Called the front desk inquiring about a shuttle to the airport and was told I had to call back in the morning and speak to the transportation person, when it clearly states on the website that there is shuttle service to the airport. Mattress on the bed is so hard and only two pillows that are hard too. I've also seen bugs that appear to be coming out of the sewer drains.

Lots of restaurants (for all types of pockets) on the other side of the road.Rooms lighting are very depressing. Bathrooms are not well maintained. I have lived in this hotel multiple no. of times as it was directly booked by the company. I will not waste my own money on such kind of poor service. In all the rooms I have lived in, all the bathroom drainage leaked. Every time I had a shower, the bathroom floor used to get flooded. Kitchen switches are broken in most rooms. Apart from a couple of maintenance and front desk staff, rest of the maintenance staff were out right rude, refused your requests. One time, I had a problem with the toilet seat which would not simply stand. The maintenance guy, saw that and bluntly told me, its not supposed to stand. Only after I asked to see his manager, he repaired it. Some of the housekeeping staff often refuse towels. If you have asked them to come after sometime for room cleaning, they would often no come till evening, and when reminded in the evening, they would tell 'I asked in the morning, you told no, now I donot have time'.The breakfast is terrible. It gets repeated every two/three days. The options you had have are: alu paratha on oneday, upma on another, puri bhaji on another, puri halwa on another day. For non-Indian breakfast, it rotates between, chicken liver, chicken sausage, baked beans. If you are staying for 2-3 weeks, you would probably be able to predict that day's breakfast menu. :)Internet is pathetic. You will not be able to browse anything. I am not sure if the paid internet is anything better. The internet we got was usually included in the room price.","February 4, 2016","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

962,"I was planning to stay there for a month until i find my own apt. When i walked in the room.. OMG... sooo dirty. the floor in the room (just a tile, no carpet) seems like hadnt been washed for a month. The smell in the room and in the bathroom was soo awful. Dirty spots in the kitchen.. I called front desk asking for another room. The answer was that there were no available. Then i told them i am going to cancel my stay there is because to live in such dirt is unecceptable. The hotel manager called and asked to wait an hour until they will prepare another room. 3 hours later i went to check another room. Same thing! if the hotel is dirty, it is dirty in every room. The housekeeper manager was with me when i was looking at another room, i showed him the dirty spots in the kitchen and bathroom. he just said ' oh well'. I cancel my stay there and moved to the apartments across the street, who charged less, had much spacious CLEAN room. My advise - STAY AWAY from that horrible place.","February 2, 2014","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

963,We stayed hereacross 3 apartments for 3 weeks between Dec 13 and Jan 14ProsGreat location 5 minutes from Metro amd 24 h Spinneys supermarketGreat housekeeping staffQuiet gym sauna and poolBreakfast if you like Indian food is serviceableWalking distance to BurjumanMall and Karama cheap eatsTwin bed rooms are largest on 7th floorVery accommodating wrt early checkinConsAvoid a room with interconnecting doors as it will be noisy and you can hear all in the next roomLobby area a bit small but very entertaining to watch comings and goingsTV channels slightly limitedNo free wifi AED 10 dhs/hour or AED 30 for 12 hours use within a 24 hour periodSometimes you got threadbare towels but these were immediately changed on requestIn summary a proactive outfit that serves a conpetent apartment hotel operation. Be aware of noise as it is frequented by families so ask for a quiet room. Rooms are not as large as nearby Belvedere who has a better lobby area bit for what they have they work it well Don't expect frills or contemporarily designed interiors but if you want a basic apartment decorated in 1980s style it does the job,"January 24, 2014","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

964,"We stayed for 3 days, 4 nights in the London Creek Hotel in October 2013,First of all, we only got 2 single beds, when we booked for 3, Then were given a terrible quality stretcher after we had to request it.Second, The bedside lamp did not work, the lights in the bathroom did not go, had to ask for these to be rectified, which took a day.Third, Dirty!, the room was not cleaned properly, and there was still hair around in the bathroom.Fourth, One of us was confronted by two young woman at the pool and demanded our bags, they did not succeed, they were not from the hotel so security is poor.We will never be going back and do not recommend this hotel to anyone","October 26, 2013","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

971,"This was our first time to Dubai and this hotel was the last stop on. 7 week European holiday. This hotel was the worst ever. The service at reception appalling. A woman and 2 mean stood chatting to each other and didn't seem to notice customers waiting. We had 2 rooms booked a triple bed room and a double room for our family of 5. We ended up with 2 rooms with a double bed on each. They said they would bring a mattress. After waiting all day and asking several times the mattress turned up well after 7pm. Our children were very tired by now. We only,had 1 towel in one room and 2 towels in,the other room. Very stained and old towels and bathroom filthy with mould ,everywhere. The room smelt too. Very disappointed with our first,impression of Dubai would never recommend this hotel to anyone.","July 17, 2012","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

972,"I was in Dubai for a friend's wedding and stayed at London Creek. They sent a complimentary cab to pick me up from the airport. On arrival, I had to wait almost an hour to get the room keys. I feel like the front office is understaffed, considering they have to deal with the newly arrived guests and also cater to phones ringing off the hook. The room was fine, small bathroom, small kitchen with cutlery items. One issue was that I had booked a room with twin beds since a friend of mine was also going to stay over for a night, but they gave me a double bed. I called them up 3-4 times and they kept telling me to give them 30 mins and they would change the room, but they never did. The best thing about this place is its location, very close to a 24 hr supermarket and also very close to the Karama metro station. If not for the comparatively cheaper rates, I wouldn't go back.","May 16, 2012","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

973,"Seriously is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Got there and room was filthy and stunk (also didn't have washing machine as mentioned when booking). Bathroom had mould, there was loose wiring in kitchen, bedsheets were filthy, walls had damp marks all over them (will upload pics soon). We asked to change rooms and were shown 3 others and they were in exactly the same condition. When asking for a different room the staff weren't surprised by my comments on the room, seemed like they'd heard it all before.  finally got a different room on the 5th floor the next day which was a lot better. Found staff to be very rude and arrogant, only members of staff that actually spoke to us during our 8 days there were the cleaner and the male nightshift receptionist.","March 17, 2012","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

975,"We booked on bookings.com. Our reservation was for 2 adults and 1 child. On arrival, we went to the front desk to check in. It looked as though the two people at reception had a fall out. She rolled her eyes at him, and he was very miserable to us, which I suppose should have tipped us off to what the rest of our stay would be like. When we got to the room, we were a bit put off, but i checked the bedding, and it was clean, so decided to stay. After spending a bit more time in room 407, we began noticing the 'grossness'. The bedrooms walls are filthy. The curtains untidy and smelly, the mats on the floor were filthy too. When checking the phone book to call a taxi, the dust on the cover was beyond shocking. The entire bedstand hadnt been cleaned in ages. The dust was so thick. The room with the iron was also dirty.Onto the lounge.... The couch was dirty, the mat was dirty and the table hadnt been wiped down from the previous peoples coffee cups.Reception staff were slow. Our kettle wasnt working, so i called for a replacement. It was quickly replaced. But when i saw we had no bedding for the filthy (broken) sleeper couch, i called reception again. 3 times i made the request for bedding. They didnt seem to care that i had a child that needed to sleep. Our first call was at 6pm, 20:45 it was received. There are also no plugs in the bathroom for the bath.We should have known room service wouldnt be good. The chips were either burnt, or the oil they were fried in, old. Probably old, as it seems to me tht everyone in this establishment is too lazy to get up!Breakfast was included, but rather unappealing.We chose this place because of its location and price. We have paid less for much better accomodation in the same area. And even if its not the best accomodation, i expect it to be clean. This is the worst place we have ever stayed, and will never recommend it to anyone and never stay there again. Whoever owns the London Creek should seriously rethink the management staff.

977,"Ever heard, if not experienced, a hotel cancelling your reservation since some others have simply extended their stay! Not sure if one should say worse or comic when it happens twice! The first time it happened due to a hockey team I was told. Guess this time its a football team! However, the decision making is anything but sporty. Infact its the most unprofessional I have seen. How would you react when you hear a hotel say that although you may land at xx hrs at the hotel, and inspite having a confirmed reservation, we cannot estimate how long you will have to wait until a room is provided to you! How is that a confirmed reservation then?Off all the smart communication, I was asked ""Sir, why do you take flights that land in the morning before our regular check in & out times?!!"" I was confused between deciding to laugh or get angry. The official communication (written and oral) from the reservation dept is a joke. Do not take them seriously else your BP levels will run a riot.I have many more words to say about this hotel, however, they all share the same tone - Negative (to say the least and control myself to be as polite in such a public forum).Will not waste my time and effort if I were you in contacting this hotel. You may receive a confirmation letter only to be cancelled few days before your actual travel! I would not recommend this hotel even if you were the kinds that loved adventure! :)","July 19, 2011","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

978,"Due to medical procedures of me and my spouse and a prolonged stay we looked for a low priced but comfortable apartment reasonably near Health Care City. The studio was adequate though a little claustrophobic, with a tiny kitchen, small bath and basic necessities. We had bargained for internet included in our rate. The hotel is near a Spinneys market that has everything. the owner and staff were very nice and taxis were easy to find on the street outside. Not much for atmosphere or view though.","April 24, 2011","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments

979,"Stayed here in January 2011 for 4 nights thought the hotel was clean, friendly but our mattress was a bit poor and cheap. Other than thatthe location was a bit secluded the taxi drivers used to get confused so used to ask then to drop us off at burjaman centre and we used to walk it down. At least spinnys was just 2 minutes away. Overall I most probably not go back only because I want somewhere more closer to the beach. The breakfast was nice and very asain plus continental different everyday.","February 20, 2011","29    London Creek Hotel Apartments
